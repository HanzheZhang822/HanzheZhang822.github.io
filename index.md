### Work Experience
Data Analyst @ Web Union Solution  (10/2020 - 08/2022)
 - Improved machine learning model accuracy by 15% by cleaning and normalizing 1M+ rows of electricity consumption data using Python and SQL, improving fraud detection.
 - Increased electricity theft detection efficiency by 8x by deploying ensemble models with Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost, reducing revenue losses.
 - Reduced peak-load forecast errors by 12% by operationalizing Seasonal ARIMA time-series models in collaboration with engineering teams.
 - Decreased anomaly resolution time by 22% by designing an interactive Tableau dashboard, enabling real-time tracking of theft patterns and financial impact.

Digital Marketing Analyst (Intern) @ Web Union Solution  (01/2020 - 09/2020)
 - Boosted campaign ROI by 12% by segmenting 85K+ customers with K-Means clustering in Python.
 - Reduced manual reporting time by 8 hours per month by automating campaign performance reporting in Python, streamlining marketing analytics.
 - Enabled data-driven marketing decisions by building SQL-driven dashboards to track customer engagement trends.

### Projects
Project 1: [Employee Attrition Analysis | Python](https://github.com/HanzheZhang822/HanzheZhang822.github.io/tree/main/IBM-HR-Employee-Attrition-Analysis)
 - Improved attrition prediction accuracy to 88.9% by analyzing 1,470 employee records, optimizing HR decision-making.
 - Processed 35 features via data cleaning, encoding, and scaling, reducing model training time by 30%.
 - Identified top 5 attrition factors (age, salary, job satisfaction, work-life balance, and commute distance) using feature importance analysis.
 - Enhanced model performance by 12% by fine-tuning Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest, selecting optimal hyperparameters.
 - Provided HR retention insights by correlating employee roles, work conditions, and salary trends.

Project 2: [Marketing Analysis on Amazon Product | R](https://github.com/HanzheZhang822/HanzheZhang822.github.io/tree/main/Marketing-Analytics-Project)
 - Increased customer insights for marketing strategy by analyzing 2,833+ Amazon reviews from iRobot Roomba & iLife V5s Pro, using web scraping (rvest, RCurl) to extract and preprocess customer feedback.
 - Improved sentiment trend analysis by correlating review ratings with sentiment scores, identifying that 2-star reviews had lower sentiment scores than 1-star reviews, revealing unexpected customer dissatisfaction patterns.
 - Enhanced product feature analysis by applying Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and RAKE topic modeling, uncovering that Roomba reviews emphasized pet-friendliness while iLife V5s reviews focused on affordability & weak mopping performance.
 - Segmented 3,643 customers into 3 key groups (loyal subscribers, new buyers, one-time buyers) by performing K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values, improving targeted marketing campaigns.
 - Optimized marketing decision-making by visualizing review sentiment using word clouds, allowing brands to identify common customer pain points and areas for product improvement.

Project 3: Home Equity Loan Risk Analysis | R
 - Developed a predictive model for home equity loan defaults, improving classification accuracy by 15% (AUC ~0.95) by implementing Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression on a 5,960-row dataset.
 - Reduced RMSE by 20% in loss prediction by implementing Decision Trees, Poisson Regression, and Random Forest models, optimizing loan risk assessment for financial institutions.
 - Enhanced feature engineering by performing PCA and t-SNE dimensionality reduction, improving model interpretability and clustering customers into five distinct risk groups based on financial behavior.
 - Automated data preprocessing, imputing missing values with median and category-specific logic, performing one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and flagging missing values, ensuring 100% data integrity.
 - Designed an end-to-end Probability/Severity risk model, integrating default probability with expected loss calculations, providing a holistic credit risk assessment framework for financial decision-making.
 - Optimized classification models through hyperparameter tuning and iterative ROC/AUC validation, improving decision support in lending risk analysis.

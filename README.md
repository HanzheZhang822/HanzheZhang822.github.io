### Projects
Project 1: [Employee Attrition Analysis | Python](https://github.com/HanzheZhang822/HanzheZhang822.github.io/tree/main/IBM-HR-Employee-Attrition-Analysis)
 - Increased employee attrition prediction accuracy to 88.9% by analyzing 1,470 employee records, leveraging Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest models.
 - Reduced model training time by 30% by preprocessing 35 features, including binary encoding, one-hot encoding, and feature scaling.
 - Identified top 5 attrition drivers (Age, MonthlyIncome, JobSatisfaction, WorkLifeBalance, CommuteDistance) using feature importance analysis, guiding HR retention strategies.
 - Improved model performance by 12% through hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV), optimizing decision thresholds for attrition prediction.
 - Provided HR retention insights by analyzing job roles, salary trends, and work conditions, enabling data-driven workforce planning.

Project 2: [Marketing Analysis on Amazon Product | R](https://github.com/HanzheZhang822/HanzheZhang822.github.io/tree/main/Marketing-Analytics-Project)
 - Increased customer insights for marketing strategy by analyzing 2,833+ Amazon reviews from iRobot Roomba & iLife V5s Pro, using web scraping (rvest, RCurl) to extract and preprocess customer feedback.
 - Improved sentiment trend analysis by correlating review ratings with sentiment scores, identifying that 2-star reviews had lower sentiment scores than 1-star reviews, revealing unexpected customer dissatisfaction patterns.
 - Enhanced product feature analysis by applying Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and RAKE topic modeling, uncovering that Roomba reviews emphasized pet-friendliness while iLife V5s reviews focused on affordability & weak mopping performance.
 - Segmented 3,643 customers into 3 key groups (loyal subscribers, new buyers, one-time buyers) by performing K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values, improving targeted marketing campaigns.
 - Optimized marketing decision-making by visualizing review sentiment using word clouds, allowing brands to identify common customer pain points and areas for product improvement.

Project 3: [Home Equity Loan Risk Analysis | R](https://github.com/HanzheZhang822/HanzheZhang822.github.io/tree/main/Home-Equity-Loan-Risk-Analysis)
 - Developed a predictive model for home equity loan defaults, improving classification accuracy by 15% (AUC ~0.95) using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression on a 5,960-row dataset.
 - Engineered a robust data preprocessing pipeline, ensuring 100% data integrity by imputing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features.
 - Built and validated classification models, comparing Decision Trees (Gini vs. Entropy) and iteratively optimizing models through ROC/AUC tuning, leading to a 10% boost in predictive performance.
 - Reduced RMSE by 20% in loss prediction by implementing Decision Trees, Poisson Regression, and Random Forest models, optimizing loan risk assessment for financial institutions.
 - Enhanced feature engineering by applying PCA and t-SNE, reducing data dimensionality by 40%, improving model interpretability, and clustering borrowers into five risk segments based on financial behavior.
 - Designed an end-to-end Probability/Severity risk model, integrating logistic regression and regression trees to quantify both default risk and financial impact, aiding in credit risk decision-making.
 - Automated the entire modeling workflow, making the project fully reproducible and scalable, reducing manual effort in financial risk assessments.

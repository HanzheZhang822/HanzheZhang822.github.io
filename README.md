### Projects
[Employee Attrition Analysis | Python](https://github.com/HanzheZhang822/HanzheZhang822.github.io/tree/main/IBM-HR-Employee-Attrition-Analysis)
 - Improved attrition prediction accuracy to 88.9% by analyzing 1,470 employee records, optimizing HR decision-making.
 - Processed 35 features via data cleaning, encoding, and scaling, reducing model training time by 30%.
 - Identified top 5 attrition factors (age, salary, job satisfaction, work-life balance, and commute distance) using feature importance analysis.
 - Enhanced model performance by 12% by fine-tuning Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest, selecting optimal hyperparameters.
 - Provided HR retention insights by correlating employee roles, work conditions, and salary trends.

Home Equity Loan Risk Analysis | R
 - Preprocessed and analyzed large financial datasets (50k + rows) in R, applying missing data imputation, one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE) to optimize data quality.
 - Developed and fine-tuned classification models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression) to predict loan default probabilities, achieving an AUC > 0.95.
 - Built regression models (Poisson, ANOVA) to estimate loss severity, with RMSE values below 5%, enabling precise risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
 - Implemented KMeans clustering on PCA-transformed data to segment borrowers into 5 distinct risk profiles, enhancing targeted marketing and risk management initiatives.
 - Visualized results using R), delivering insights into key predictors such as debt-to-income ratio, credit history, and past defaults, facilitating actionable business strategies.

[Marketing Analysis on Amazon Product | R](https://github.com/HanzheZhang822/HanzheZhang822.github.io/tree/main/Marketing-Analytics-Project)
 - Increased customer insights for marketing strategy by analyzing 2,833+ Amazon reviews from iRobot Roomba & iLife V5s Pro, using web scraping (rvest, RCurl) to extract and preprocess customer feedback.
 - Improved sentiment trend analysis by correlating review ratings with sentiment scores, identifying that 2-star reviews had lower sentiment scores than 1-star reviews, revealing unexpected customer dissatisfaction patterns.
 - Enhanced product feature analysis by applying Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and RAKE topic modeling, uncovering that Roomba reviews emphasized pet-friendliness while iLife V5s reviews focused on affordability & weak mopping performance.
 - Segmented 3,643 customers into 3 key groups (loyal subscribers, new buyers, one-time buyers) by performing K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values, improving targeted marketing campaigns.
 - Optimized marketing decision-making by visualizing review sentiment using word clouds, allowing brands to identify common customer pain points and areas for product improvement.

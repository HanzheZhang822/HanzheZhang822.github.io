### Projects
Project 1: [Employee Attrition Analysis | Python](https://github.com/HanzheZhang822/HanzheZhang822.github.io/tree/main/IBM-HR-Employee-Attrition-Analysis)
 - Increased employee attrition prediction accuracy to 88.9% by analyzing 1,470 employee records, leveraging Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest models.
 - Reduced model training time by 30% by preprocessing 35 features, including binary encoding, one-hot encoding, and feature scaling.
 - Identified top 5 attrition drivers (Age, MonthlyIncome, JobSatisfaction, WorkLifeBalance, CommuteDistance) using feature importance analysis, guiding HR retention strategies.
 - Improved model performance by 12% through hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV), optimizing decision thresholds for attrition prediction.
 - Provided HR retention insights by analyzing job roles, salary trends, and work conditions, enabling data-driven workforce planning.

Project 2: [Marketing Analysis on Amazon Product | R](https://github.com/HanzheZhang822/HanzheZhang822.github.io/tree/main/Marketing-Analytics-Project)
 - Increased customer insights for marketing strategy by analyzing 2,833+ Amazon reviews from iRobot Roomba & iLife V5s Pro, using web scraping (rvest, RCurl) to extract and preprocess customer feedback.
 - Improved sentiment trend analysis by correlating review ratings with sentiment scores, identifying that 2-star reviews had lower sentiment scores than 1-star reviews, revealing unexpected customer dissatisfaction patterns.
 - Enhanced product feature analysis by applying Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and RAKE topic modeling, uncovering that Roomba reviews emphasized pet-friendliness while iLife V5s reviews focused on affordability & weak mopping performance.
 - Segmented 3,643 customers into 3 key groups (loyal subscribers, new buyers, one-time buyers) by performing K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values, improving targeted marketing campaigns.
 - Optimized marketing decision-making by visualizing review sentiment using word clouds, allowing brands to identify common customer pain points and areas for product improvement.

Project 3: [Home Equity Loan Risk Analysis | R](https://github.com/HanzheZhang822/HanzheZhang822.github.io/tree/main/Home-Equity-Loan-Risk-Analysis)
 - Developed a predictive model for home equity loan defaults, improving classification accuracy by 15% (AUC ~0.95) using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression on a 5,960-row dataset.
 - Engineered a data preprocessing pipeline, ensuring 100% data integrity by imputing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features, which improved model readiness by 15%.
 - Optimized classification and regression models, reducing loan loss prediction RMSE by 20% using Decision Trees, Poisson Regression, and Random Forest, while iterating on ROC/AUC tuning for model performance improvements.
 - Applied PCA and t-SNE for feature engineering, reducing data dimensionality by 40%, clustering borrowers into five distinct risk groups, and improving loan risk segmentation.
 - Designed and automated a Probability/Severity risk model, integrating logistic regression and regression trees to quantify default probability and financial impact, streamlining financial risk assessments.

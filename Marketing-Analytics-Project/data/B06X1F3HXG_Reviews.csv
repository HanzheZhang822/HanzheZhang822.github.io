"1","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","Our vacuum committed suicide","Lizz","July 29, 2018","Size: V5s ProVerified Purchase",1,"I wish that I could say that everything was going fine until Rosie, our vacuuming unit, hurled herself down the stairs, but I feel I must be truthful. In reality, Rosie missed large swaths of the rooms she had been assigned to, as well as seeming to obsess over areas she had cleaned several times already.Although the descriptions here imply that she needs no supervision, she required our assistance in scaling even the smallest hurdles (the sloping 1/2"" barriers that divide our rooms derailed her completely) and needed to be picked up and carried over them.The final blow came when, in the middle of a routine sweep of the living room, she reached the edge of the stairs. Normally she would come just over the edge and stop, beep and retreat, but on this fateful evening Rosie had other plans. Without so much as a glance backward at us, she sailed over the lip of the top step and crashed down all 17, landing with a rattle at the bottom. We rushed to her aid but alas, peered over the banister only to find her in pieces by the front door, one wheel still spinning idly.In addition to the trauma caused by losing a valued member of our household, we find ourselves up to our ankles in furballs and dustbunnies. Rosie, you are gone, but your careless legacy lives on.",649

"3","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","Promising, but disappointing","Review Panda","June 23, 2017","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",2," I read a lot about robot vacuums and was swayed by the Amazon reviews on the iLife V5s. Unfortunately, my experience has been less than stellar and I'm considering returning this and trying out another brand. There are a couple of things you should consider before purchasing this vacuum:* The vacuum does not follow any kind of logical route that means that it will go over some areas multiple times and others only once. If you vacuum a big room you'll have dirty areas left over, which is a big minus. If you vacuum a small room then it will do OK.* This vacuum gets stuck very easily. I ran it 3-4 times before I figured out what furniture/shoes/chairs and other items I had to move to another room for the vacuum to not get stuck. Even then it sometimes would just randomly get stuck on the wall (see video). Once it gets stuck, it doesn't realize it, so prepare for it to spin in place until it runs out of battery.* The ""plan"" feature on the vacuum is unreliable. I always schedule the vacuum to do its work at night. However, half the time, fully charged, it never actually turns on.* The dirt bin is really small and once it fills up then it will stop picking things up. Not a big deal breaker, but annoying.* Don't buy this for the mop. The pad barely gets wet as it moves around and basically doesn't actually clean.I reached out to customer support and it took a week to get a response, which wasn't super helpful.",178
"4","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","Best Cleaning Robot EVER!","Adrian","May 10, 2016","Size: V5s",5,"=== Original Review Written May 10, 2016 === (An update can be found below)This is the best cleaning robot ever. I don't personally own a Roomba but have seen them work. This thing is almost identical, but at the fraction of the cost. This thing is definitely worth it! It vacuums and it mops (with some adjustments). This review is based off of non-carpeted flooring only!I have the robot vacuum work about once a day in my medium sized room and it will always have in its canister a bunch of hair and at least 2 2-3 inch in diameter dust bunnies. It tends to get wedged under arch type furniture (near the ground of course). The robot seems to be afraid of its charging base; it won't go near it (approximately 0.5-1 meters / 2-3 feet), which kinda sucks for me cause it fits perfectly under my desk with the charging base, but now he (yes it is a he!) won't clean under except when he leaves the base. All in all, his vacuuming skills are pretty good! He'll also return to his base with no problems unless he gets stuck on something.I had it mop today, and it behaves practically the same as vacuuming except it is much quieter and works kinda funny. You essentially fill up the water tank and (the instructions say only add water) I added a little Mr. Clean because it feels cleaner and smells better. It mops almost identically to how it vacuums.Other thoughts:- Dang good for about $140 (can easily find it for that price at other retailers if it isn't that much on Amazon).- Mops decently. The mop can also be taken off and thrown in the wash if you like it clean clean. Might need a steam mop to follow this puppy when he's done.- Vacuums like crazy! It's dang good.- He can push heavy objects. Probably up to 30-40 pound objects if he gets stuck or wedged in them. He got wedged under a portable AC and he moved it a good 2-4 inches to free himself.- Seems to vacuum for about 2-3 hours on max on a full charge.- I usually put the charging base on top of something once in a while so that he will vacuum everywhere, since he doesn't vacuum near the base. He will usually roam around for about 30-60 minutes when he's done vacuuming looking for the base, he will eventually find it no problem unless he gets stuck on something.- Never put the charging base near an intersection of a pathway, otherwise he will never cross it and be stuck in one quadrant while vacuuming.===== Update: August 29, 2016 ===== (the last paragraph is a tl;dr)So, how has the ILIFE V5s working for me after about 3.5 months now. I have to say that it has its quirks (will talk about it below) when compared to a Roomba. Overall, I'd still rate the ILIFE V5s a 5/5. Why?- It cleans my floor regularly. Has worked predictably and reliably since the day I got it.- The replacement parts can be bought affordably from Amazon. (4 brushes, 2 filters, and 2 mop pads all for $14.99 at the time of this review).- It was much cheaper than a Roomba. I think the cheapest Roomba on sale can be bought at about $400 (at the time of this review). I picked the ILIFE V5s up from a Chinese e-retailer for about $140 (after shipping).- I can send the V5s to vacuum and forget it. Usually, before I leave my room, I set it and forget it. When I come back, 9/10 times I'll find it on the charging base. Usually it's user error that'll prevent him from getting back to the base (i.e., A cable is lying on the floor and he gets stuck on it, or I block the base with furniture).Some comments:- Navigation: I know some of my friends will say a Roomba navigates with intelligence (i.e., it can navigate your house and it kind of memorizes it), the V5s, seems to work with heuristics. That is, it tends to roam the room a little first, then clean the outside, roam, outside, roam etc. until the battery dies. It works effectively but if it is charged with cleaning a WHOLE floor, I think it might forget where its base is in a larger apartment / floor of a house.- Getting stuck: he only seems to get stuck on arch type furniture. He doesn't get stuck easily except with mopping (see next comment). If he gets stuck he often will stay there and attempt to free himself a little, but then just let his battery die after that, if you don't rescue him in the next few hours. He will also repeatedly attempt to enter his base, but if there is something off to the side that triggers his bumper while he tries to park he'll reverse and attempt to park in the base repeatedly. Sometimes he will attempt to correct by going to the left or right but most the time he will fail to navigate around the object and will eventually die trying to return to the base (reversing and trying to park until battery dies).- Mopping: it mops well and there isn't much to say about it. The only problem as the V5s ages when he mops is that his wheels seem to lose grip, so when he mops on a wet floor, he gets stuck much more easily than normal. For instance, if he has mopped the area and makes a second pass while the floor is still wet, he can get stuck on the wall because his wheels don't provide him with enough grip to hit the wall and activate his bumper; thereby, getting stuck on the wall (or furniture, or pretty much anything he hits gently).- Bumping things: he can hit objects quite hard if his proximity sensors don't pick it up. For example if he hits a chair at an angle (his proximity sensors appear to be at about the 11 and 1 o'clock positions if the 12 is the path he is traveling forward in), and the chair is at his 12, he will smack the chair leg with full force. While most furniture this won't matter but if you have delicate items or something heavy on a night stand that isn't against a wall when he hits it, it can knock over some things. This does pose as a potential risk but one will learn over time that the V5s can be left unattended (I don't recommend doing this till you stay nearby the first handful of times you send the V5s to work).tl;dr:I still love my V5s. I haven't had any battery problems or functioning problems. Most issues I lined out are usually human error and normal wear and tear of the item. Few quirks with getting him to work, but once you learn them the V5s is definitely worth the investment. I have seen other Chinese Roomba-like robots, and I have to say the V5s was definitely worth every penny. I've seen other Chinese Roomba-like robots go for about $100-120, and they are definitely not worth even half their price in headaches and how inefficient they are at vacuuming. So, I have to say despite the VERY MINOR quirks I've had with the V5s, it is definitely worth it for $140. I would highly recommend this item and would recommend anyone who is considering a cheaper alternative to the Roomba pick this up.",752
"5","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","Vacuums well, mops poorly","Kypros Nighthawk","May 16, 2018","Size: V5s ProVerified Purchase",3,"I decided to get this guy more for the mopping feature than anything else, but I'll get to that in a bit and start with the good first.PROS: The unit is fairly heavy which is good, it does a pretty good job of navigating and transitions well from hard-wood floor to carpet/rugs.  The auto-home feature is really nice to have since it automatically docks itself into the charger.  It comes with normal and max vacuum mode and it picks up quite a good bit of dirt (It's no Dyson, so don't expect it to compete with an upright vac).  It came with plenty of accessories as well as replacement parts.  It also comes with a mopping feature as well as a reservoir for the mop.  The remote control is a nice touch and allows you to program an auto-run timer as well as offers limited directional control.CONS: The mopping feature is pathetic.  The tank constantly leaks when filling it and when mounted in the machine, doesn't uniformly distribute the solution onto the mopping pad so as it mops it leaves streaks on the floor because the middle is try and the edges are damp.  The AI is not very bright, it'll repeatedly go over the same areas multiple times while completely avoiding and missing other spots.  Due to it's ability to only turn at 20degree angles or so, it zig-zags.  Another annoying issue is in mop mode, it will still go over area rugs, which ends up causing the unit to deposit all the collected dirt/dust on the mop right onto the rug.  I've also had the unit get stuck on raised (wood) vent grills.THOUGHTS:  The mopping issue, along with the water tank leaking all over the place is really disappointing, and I wish the AI knew not to go over carpets/rugs with the mop attached because it just makes the carpet messy.  I also wish it had a better way to map areas, such as a phone app or something that would let you limit the unit to certain rooms or distances so it'll actually clean a whole room, rather than wander around doing half a job.",50
"6","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","ILIFE V5s is Great - See Video Review","Dylan","January 10, 2017","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",5," The V5s robot vacuum by iLife is a fantastic product for a number of reasons: price, functionality, and convenience, just to name three.We like it so much, we even named this little guy. Even though his big brother might be more powerful, he does a good job on most surfaces. We have hardwood in most of our home, with throw rugs and tile. There are times he gets stuck on cords, but 99% of the time he does what he is supposed to.We only tried the wet cycle once, and it seemed to work well, but our main purpose for this unit is to cut down on the amount of housework we need to do. You are not supposed to add soaps to the water tank, because while it can still function with soap, it isn't going to clean the soap up unless you then run it 2-3x over the same area with a fresh tank of water. Otherwise, your floor will be sticky. If you're looking for a wet mop primarily (we weren't because we have hardwood floors), you probably need something like this robot wet mop instead: http://amzn.to/2jbfFOCCons: He isn't always great at finding his charging station on his own, but that isn't an issue for us, and it is probably our fault because we tucked it away so it is inconspicuous.We've told our friends about this more than once, and would definitely recommend the iLife Robot Vacuum Cleaner. Feel free to ask me questions below...happy to help.",51
"7","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","I just received this yesterday and I'm in love with my little floor cleaning robot","Baroque Pearl","August 7, 2017","Size: V5s ProVerified Purchase",5,"I just received this yesterday and I'm in love with my little floor cleaning robot! I have wood floor through out the house, tile in my foyer & bathrooms and laminate in my eat in kitchen. Today I vaccumed my foyer, living room, dining room & kitchen earlier in the day. I was really impressed. This little baby did a great job! At first I was a bit skeptical because the robot was moving randomly which made it look like it was going to miss corners and many other places.... well give the kid 30 minutes, walk away do your other stuff, come back, your floor is so incredibly clean! Later in the evening I put in the water tank, installed the mopping disc/cloth & send the kid to work. Again I was skeptical. The cloth was thin & flat. It stayed kind of dry at first. I actually wetted it before I let it clean more. BUT! It didn't stay dry. The water tank did a good job! And the cloth cleaned close to 800-900 sq ft perfectly. I have to confess, I'm terrible at housework. But now my floor is so so so clean, I can eat off of it! It's never been this clean without someone else doing the job! I know I'm not supposed to but another reviewer mentioned she put a bit of cleaner in the water tank.... well I did as well. And it worked out very well. But it was really watered down. And the mopping cloth cleaned up just like that when I hand washed it afterwards. I am very pleased with its sweeping/vacuuming/mopping prowess so far! The 2 little brushes out front really did the trick!! So far, I highly recommend it. I'll update this review if i found anything else (positive or negative) as I continue to use it. If I don't update, it'll be because it's working like a dream!",28
"8","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","I Love This Machine!","Blaine Coleman","August 28, 2018","Size: V5s ProVerified Purchase",5,"I've been using this great little robot cleaner for nearly a year and couldn't live without it! We have two beagles that shed hair constantly and this machine does a great job of getting it all. I learned the hard way that it is very sensitive to any nearby electronic devices ( even our oven and washer/dryer interfered with it's charging). We thought we had the charging base in a good place and the vacuum worked for several months, then began going in circles and returning to its base. The company sent me a replacement at no cost, even though I should've been charged for the shipping, and when that unit began having the same issue, we moved the charging base to an unused bedroom and it has worked perfectly ever since. The issue must've been that the original location was within about ten-feet of the kitchen range and washer/dryer. It did stop working again recently, but a call to the service department cleared up that issue- the switch on the side had apparently been turned off when I was cleaning the vacuum. Customer service has been excellent and frankly, if this unit eventually quits working I will buy another- it's a lifesaver when it comes to keeping the hardwood and tile floors clean. We typically run it every other day and it does exactly what we need.",16

"11","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","So far, overall a really good product for the price","K. Allison","December 21, 2017","Size: V5s ProVerified Purchase",4,"Pros: Easy set-up right out of the box, does a good job cleaning up crumbs and pet hair, remote is easy to use and comes with batteries, charges quickly, with the water tank it keeps the pad wet and distributes cleaner evenly, has a MAX vacuum setting, has a spot cleaner option that works really well in mop mode, has a timer option to run automatically once a day, it's relatively quiet, it will slow down before it reaches the wall so no hard bumping into the wall. Customer service is very reliable and comes with a one-year manufacturer's warranty.Cons: Out of the box the side brushes attached to the robot came out bent and unusable (will call manufacturer about it today and will update regarding their service afterwards-UPDATE: customer service was excellent! Real person picked up after the first couple rings and as soon as I described the issue he simply requested my address and I should have my replacement parts by the end of the week.), the instruction manual is poorly translated into English but you can get the gist of it, when it goes to it's home base the brushes keep rotating and will knock the charger sideways which results in this thing making several attempts to dock (I may place some double-sided tape underneath the base to keep it in place), if it's too far from it's home it will ""forget"" where it's charging dock is, you have to set up barriers if you don't want it going into a particular area, it got stuck under my fridge twice so will have to set up a barrier there as well.",14
"12","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","Great little cleaner, great price!","T. Ellison","April 7, 2018","Size: V5s ProVerified Purchase",4,"Unboxing / First Impressions: Product received in great packaging.  Once unboxed, read through the manual and quick setup guides. Though English was not that great it was easy enough to get through. I set the little vac, which my 4 yr old named Winston, into its charger and charged it up.First Run/Impressions: I have a 2 story home with downstairs being hardwood floors and ceramic tile comprising approx. 1200 sf of space on the 1st floor..  A living room, Dining room with lots of furniture, breakfast room with table/chairs and hutch, a kitchen with an island and a living room with 4 chairs, sofa, coffee table, and a lg armoire.  When I pushed clean to start the dry vac process the unit began to move about cleaning in a fairly random pattern, softly bumping into furniture and working to move around items.  After a while I noticed it would move around to a chair or table and begin a move to go around a leg once it seemed to determine it was in fact a leg of a chair or table. If it found the item to be a larger piece with long sides like cabinets or an armoire it would go along cleaning the edges.  While it moved through the rooms it was more random than expected and seemed to go over some spots more than others.  It did a really good job of cleaning around the oak chairs at the breakfast table.  I have two thick matts in the kitchen for standing, it had no problems getting up on those.  I have a 3 X 5 rug at the front door, this was a little bit of an issue as the little brushes tended to go under the edge picking up the edge of the carpet and causing the vac to backup or flip the rug up and cause it to jump over or again, back up. This was not all the time.Cleaning Power: I will say it did a great job cleaning up dirt, sand, dust, small items from the floor.  I let it run for about an hour and it swept most of the 1200 sf or so of hard floors.  I emptied the container once abt 45 mins in and let it go on it's way.Issues I ran into: The little vac, which was named Winston at first, but has since been renamed ""Romi"" by my 4 yo, did have an issue when it decided to clean under my large sofa (it didn't have issues with the skirt by the way.)  I happened to have my wireless rear audio speakers behind the sofa and the little vac found the wires and got them tangled in the brush. This stopped the unit cold.  I had to look around after not hearing it anymore to finally find it under the sofa shut off.  I untangled the wire, checked unit for issues (none) and hit Clean again, and off it went like nothing ever happened.Completing the Cleaning: I didn't run the vac until it stopped on it's own.  We had to get to bed so I used the provided remote and pointing it at ""Romi's"" front (the remote appears to use IR, not RF) it shut down the vacuum, put little brushes in a low/slow power mode and began to go in a ""follow the left side"" of the room method to find its way back to the charging base.  This seemed a little like a blind person in a strange room following along a wall.  After 5 mins or so, Romi got within 5 ft of the charging base and seemed to see it.  At this point it lined itself up and slowly proceeded to guide itself back on to the base and started charging for the night.PROS:- Good price!  Can't beat the price for a vac and this one will do wet service but have not tried that yet.- Great cleaning!  It did a really good job cleaning the hard floors. I have not tried it on low pile carpet but will do that and provide feedback.- Quiet.  This is MUCH quieter than our Shark and other vacuums.CONS:- Not as sophisticated as much more expensive units.- Does not appear to have a memory of the floor or room layout- Does not connect to Wifi- Does not have reports on how/where it cleaned, etc.OVERALL:If you want a good sweeper unit without all the fancy junk that makes units cost 3 or 4 times as much, this is your guy!  It does a great job sweeping hard floors can get under items that have about 4-5"" of clearance, doens't have issues with skirts on sofas, and gets around chair and table legs to clean under furniture!",12
"13","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","Good price but don't be fooled by mopping option","M. B. Billiodeaux","March 2, 2017","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",4,"This robot is not the most intelligent however it does a decent job, especially for the price.I purchased it because I want something to routinely sweep/ vacuum, and do a quick mop everyday. But in order to mop you have to manually install a cloth to the bottom of the robot and remove a Dustbin from inside the robot  and replace it with a small water reservoir, and immediately begin using the robot because gravity slowly pulls the water out. All the robot does really, is wipe  up the water that was deposited. I would have been more impressed if the little sweepers were replaced with rotating cloth scrubbers, so that instead of wiping up water, whenever the mop mode was on it would also do a light scrub.So, because of the rudimentary mop option, and the preparation required to switch into it, as things stand, this robot is merely my dumb little sweeper...But don't think this is a bad review! This robot gets the job done, is at good price, and is durable!As a note of comparison, I have never used a Rumba before and can imagine a myriad of ways the AI design of this little bot could be improved, however I doubt Roomba actually implements a better AI... and even if they did I can't imagine it being worth $700 more.",43
"14","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","The brushes may look a little pathetic, but they manage to chase debris straight into ...","Jlynn","May 4, 2017","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",5,"Works rather shockingly well. The brushes may look a little pathetic, but they manage to chase debris straight into the vacuum just fine, including spilled cat food along the edges of the wall. It makes it all the way through the house, including down the hallway leading to the bedrooms. With how random its movements appear, I'd have figured that it would have gotten turned around long before it made it back there, but instead I often find it vacuuming under the beds--a place that I simply never really get to when I'm vacuuming myself--as well as the bathrooms.As for the mopping feature though, I can't say as I'm overly impressed. It does fine in a smaller area--like if I block off the kitchen from the rest of the house and force it to only mop that room--but the lack of ""virtual wall"" to keep it off the carpeted areas makes it too much of a hassle to use. The mopping pad can become dirty quickly, and there is simply no way for the machine to ""rinse"" it, so it ends up just smearing a dirty cloth around after a while. It works okay if you're there and can stop the machine occasionally to rinse the pad yourself, but I personally prefer to just mop the floors myself. It's cleaner that way.Just as a vacuum though, this unit is great. And even the mop feature is acceptable for a small area. I have recommended this brand to friends and family who want a vacuum robot, but are aghast at the price of the Roomba. I have a friend who has one of those, and I can see absolutely no difference in the job that her $600+ Roomba does over my under $200 ILIFE.",10

L","October 25, 2017","Size: V5s ProVerified Purchase",5,"This product is a self-sufficient device that will vacuum the floor! There’s 4 cleaning modes: auto clean (automatic cleaning of the floor), spot clean (deep cleaning on specific areas), edge clean (cleaning alongside wall sides), and scheduling clean (cleaning during specific time frames). The vacuum also has a new mode called “max mode” which is used to pick up pet furs, debris, and dirt. So definitely a good addition if your pet tends to shed. The battery life is also relatively long, around 2 hour. This robot has saved me a lot of time and energy used on previous manual methods of cleaning. Definitely worth the price and a good investment!",9
"18","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","Highly Recommend Overall","jmays2800","December 18, 2017","Size: V5s ProVerified Purchase",5,"Hubby gifted this to me for Christmas (before Christmas--hahaha).  I love it!  We have all laminate hardwood floors, and I am OCD about keeping the floors clean with three cats and a puppy.  I would sweep/mop several times per week, and I still felt the floor wasn't clean.  I really love this robot (Rosie) overall and recommend it to friends and family especially with limited time or back/health issues, but see below for more detailed comments.Vacuuming:I feel this vacuums the floors perfectly; Rosie has all terrain wheels and can get out of most cases when it is caught.  I have several floor transition strips, one about 1/2 inch high, and Rosie goes over it no problem.  As you use it, you will learn where it gets stuck and how to solve it; Rosie finally motivated me to clean up the wire mess behind/underneath the TV console since she kept getting caught.  I pick up my floor rugs because she does get stuck on them (they are not hard on the bottom, but they are washable rugs--really can't describe them much better).  The only furniture it cannot go under is the couch which is low profile, but it gets under the beds, futons, entertainment centers, and cabinets.I thought I kept my floor pretty clean, but I've used it several times a week for the last three weeks and had to empty the bin in the middle of cleaning!  Week 3 and I don't need to empty it as much.  She picks up big pieces; the pattern she vacuums is random, but she does get the entire floor done.  I have not used the spot or edging functions since she does those every time she runs.  She runs for about 150 minutes (2.5 hours) when fully charged.One con is that there is no barrier function to this robot like with the Rumba--not a big deal, but it would be nice to keep her out of the kitchen when I am making dinner.  Another *slight* con is that the scheduling function is very minimal--you can set it for one time and that's it.  You can't schedule days or anything else.  I have tried to cancel the scheduling function since I don't have a consistent time that works for me, but she wouldn't quit the schedule although I followed the website directions.  I just turn her off when I don't want her to run.  I don't do the bedrooms all the time so I close the doors to keep her in the main area (laundry room, kitchen, and living room on a one story).AS A PET OWNER DO NOT RUN THIS UNLESS YOU ARE AT HOME!  If there is vomit or urine or feces, she will pick it up/spread it around the house!Mopping:I am still iffy on the mopping part.  You can't use detergent to mop, only water, so I am not completely happy about that.  I do still ""hand mop"" high traffic or very dirty areas like in the kitchen, in front of outside doors, and places puppy likes to mess (yay housetraining!).  Otherwise, Rosie mops the rest of the house, and she does a decent job.  She still does the random pattern when mopping but not a big deal.  Even if I am not completely satisfied with the mopping portion, the vacuuming portion is spectacular so I am okay with it.",6

Overall, this is meant for light vacuuming and when it encounters dog hair under the larger living room furniture, it tends to come out with a belly full of dog hair and needs to be emptied.  In open floor space and hall ways, it works great -- we have no regrets.UPDATE:  This robo cleaning unit is not made for a large house, but I recommend it for a small to medium sized residence with a minimum of carpeted floors, since it does not function well on carpets.  The tiny trash bin inside is simply not suitable for cleaning large floor areas, especially for floors cluttered with clumps of dog hair, for instance, since we have two dogs that shed year round and have found this to be a problem.  It is best suited to light dust and dirt, perhaps an occasional cookie crumb, grain of rice, things of that sort.Worse yet, since I have endured a barrage of health issues since early December and unable to do much, this unit has not been run for a couple of months and now it won't take off and clean, but leaves the charging station, starts across the room, then immediately returns to the charging station -- it appears that the extended idle time has not been good for the machine, or more specifically, the battery.Unless you live in a relatively small home and use this machine nearly every day and have no heavily shedding pets, I cannot recommend this ILIFE Robot Vacuum machine.",6

I had no idea my house was this dirty. Two teenagers, and man in construction, a dog, and a cat plus me.He is a little loud..but i think its been said before. Its like a kid..of hes quiet.(reminds me of a cat playing).you should probably go check on him.  Hes very good at getting himself out of tight spots but will definitely get caught on curtains and cords.  He has bumper sensors and you can see where he gets close and automatically slows (think gas pump slow when you get close to paid amount) to feel it out. I did notice that items have to be taller than a inch..maybe two or the sensors dont pick up.  He is fearless and keeps trying to get up on spots he shouldnt (that are a little too high) and makes a big fuss about trying to the point i think hes going to hurt himself.

Would recommend to anyone!","Heather A","March 12, 2017","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",5,"Love, Love, Love this vacuum!!! I have 2 dogs, 3 kids and a handicapped husband that all bring an astounding amount of dirt into the house. I could never keep up so I purchased this vacuum in hopes of staying more on top of the dirt. I cleaned my floors before I started the vacuum for the first time. As suggested by previous reviews I just wanted to see if there were places it would get stuck, I didn't really think it would get much dirt. Half way through the first cleaning it found a straw wrapper under a chair that it was dragging around with it. When I opened up the cleaning bin to clear the wrapper I was shocked to find it completely full! I thought the floors were clean! This little vacuum found 2 more bins full of dirt that I had missed. I have had this for a week and have it programmed to vacuum when I am at work. I love coming home to clean floors! My kids like to turn it on and watch it clean. Between the schedule and my kids this vacuum probably runs 2-3 times per day and every time it finishes it has a full dirt bin. I don't know where it is finding it, but wow! At first the dirt was big chunks and grass clippings etc. now the bin is full of dust bunnies and very fine dirt.This vacuum has no issues goes over the transition treads between rooms. It gets onto my area rugs without hesitation and goes from carpet to linoleum with ease. This vacuum is also quieter than a conventional vacuum so I have run it at night and in the morning while my family is asleep and it does not disturb them. I would defiantly recommend this vacuum to anyone that was looking for one. I have NO complaints!",15
"24","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","Amazing!!","Jim K.","May 4, 2018","Size: V5s ProVerified Purchase",5,"Amazing!!!  Our house is the cleanest its been in a while.  We have a Belgion Malaware (shepard dog) the sheds hair constantly.  In order to keep up with it you have to vacuum everyday.  We have a dyson vacuum that is bulky and to be honest we don'y have time to vacuum everyday.  The ILIFE picks up at least a cup of dog hair everyday.  By no means is this going to end your vacuuming choirs.  We have throw and accent carpets on hardwood floors.  The robot climbs these easily and vacuumes but you will need to vacuum with heavy vac with strong brushes to clean pile.  This thing cleans a seven room home.  It will run for an hour and half easily (not on max setting).  I have never exhausted it entirely and have sent it back to its base before the power has run down.  It climbs door thresholds and carpets easily and has a feature which raises the wheels to hop over obstacles.  It can get caught on wires and toys.  You will learn the places it get stuck after several days and you can take measures to avoid them in future.  As an example it would get tangled in speaker wires behind the stereo cabinet.  It fit under the cabinet, cleaned an area never cleaned before and got tangled in the wires.  I placed a piece of wood under the cabinet and protected the wires from getting stuck.  If it does get stuck in wires it has an automatic shutdown so it doesn't continually run.  My suggestion run it for a week under supervision and you will learn where it has challenges getting stuck and modify the problem area if you can.  It is relatively quiet and i have gotten used to the sound.  I tried the mop feature and was impressed.  I used distilled water and added murphy's wood soap and poured it in the hopper and it did a good job on the floors.  Note if you have serious stains like scuff marks etc. don't expect the robot to get these out.  I used distilled water because we have very hard water and the water will leave water spots on the floor.  I am very satisfied with mine,  I had realistic expectations, and it's exceeded them.  I did buy the protection plan for two years and have peace of mind that at the end of two years if it dies i will buy another one.",6
"25","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","She vacuums! She mops! She entertains cats!","K. Sullivan","July 10, 2018","Size: V5s ProVerified Purchase",5,"I got mine about a month-and-a-half ago and I love it! I named her Ladybug because she is the cutest thing ever. She vacuums well and gets around the house just fine. It's supposed to have something that will keep from going over a cliff, but that doesn't work so well. I tested it on stairs, but I was standing there to catch it. Good thing! Just block off the stairs if you are using her on the second floor.The cats are intrigued, and they don't get hurt if they get in the way. So far, no one has tried to take a ride.The little brushes are nice for getting stuff out of corners. The debris canister is small, so I normally stop her halfway through a cycle to empty it out if my house is extra dirty with cat hair, etc. That's not a big deal. When she runs out of juice, she goes back to her home base.The mopping function is fine. It doesn't scrub intense messes, but it works on my tile floors and laminate, and it's way better than doing nothing, which is what I used to do when I didn't have time to mop. If you have area rugs, you need to figure out how to keep her off of them when she's on mopping function. Is easy to close a bedroom door and keep her off the wall to wall carpeting, but area rugs are more of a challenge if you want the surrounding laminate to be mopped.The only problem I would like to have addressed is that I don't know if I can use cleaning solution on the mopping function. The instructions said nothing about that. I'd like to put some Bona cleaner in there, but I don't want to do any damage. So far I have just been using plain water. No, I will not put vinegar in the water and make my house smell like vinegar.Overall, a fantastic purchase! For this price, you cannot beat it. I did not need something expensive that was connected to my phone. Ladybug is just perfect.",4
"26","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","Best purchase I've made in a very long time","IrishGirl","August 22, 2017","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",5,"I'm usually an early adopter of technology, but I kept resisting robotic floor cleaners. I was concerned they would scratch the furniture, not clean well thus adding to my work and break easily. But I have a friend who kept raving about her robotic vacuum and, even though she has dogs, her floors are immaculate. I started to rethink my objections.One morning, I woke up and the floors I'd swept the night before seemed to have a film of subtle dirt and some dog hair. I'd had enough. Something had to give. I was tired of fighting dog hair and couldn't stand the endless sweeping. I also decided to see if the robotic vacuum could help my allergies by reducing dust which might be present.I decided to get a moderately priced entry product to test some of my assumptions. I have been so surprised at how well it works. As others have suggested, you need to optimize its performance by blocking areas where it gets stuck, moving cords and addressing things things that could trip it up. You also need to turn it over after every use and check that nothing has wound around the spinners.Advantages1)  The mopping function works quite well. Unlike more expensive models, you can't vacuum and mop simultaneously. You have to do it in two steps.2)  It gets up an amazing amount of dust and dog hair, even though it doesn't have a roller for carpet.3)  The transition between surfaces is flawless.4)  It does a good job of ""unsticking"" itself in most situations.5)  Very gentle on furniture. It slows down and then gently touches the furniture with its retractable bumper.6)  It's able to reach areas where vacuuming is difficult - under beds and large furniture.Disadvantages1)  There's no way to set a virtual wall when mopping, so you do have to block doorways. But then, at this price point, I figure you can't have everything.2)  When mopping, if it gets stuck, it continues to let water drip out and you can get a puddle. There's no alert or off function.3)  For some reason, my remote doesn't seem to work on ""Plan"" but I'll continue to see if I can figure that out.In the week I've had it, I've been running it several times a day, sometimes mopping, other times just vacuuming. It goes back and charges itself and is ready for its next cycle. I did figure out to get it to return to the charger, you need to start it from the charger. I read on some reviews that it starts leaving dirt balls on the floor - that only happens if it's so filled that it can't hold any more. Stop it and clean it and the problem disappears.I am so pleased with this product, I'm considering buying another one and dedicate each to a floor. No, it doesn't map the house, but I like how clean it's getting the floor, the hepa filter, the length of time it cleans and its quietness. I sometimes have to go find it to see if it's still working since I don't hear it in another room. Highly recommend this product.",5

The vacuuming function on this works great! I emptied out the collector bucket two or theee times while it was sweeping my house since it’s a smaller bucket, but I also let it sweep my whole house. It ran for maybe about an hour and a half or two and then returned to its base to charge itself. It had a hard time finding its way back at first, but eventually made it on its own. The mopping portion works well for general upkeep on floor cleaning but if there’s something caked on the floor (food, mud etc) I would mop it yourself first and let this get whatever you missed. It’s just an auto dripping water tank and a microfiber pad, but still works well! I love this and it’s made my life so much easier so far. I have it programmed for a certain time every day.I would just suggest using this while you’re home and not while you’re away, just in case it gets stuck on something",3

I am using it on tile flooring. We have several furry shedding indoor animals and have to sweep often, I now run the Beetle after sweeping and it's surprising how much fur is still present. The battery lasts a very long time, close to 2 hours, again compared to my previous robo vacs this little one runs longer than either did. Also this is so much quieter than my Neato making it way less intrusive and annoying. The pattern seems random but at the end of the run or even half way through nothing has been missed. The mopping feature doesn't seem to do much so this will be used strictly for the vacuum, I can't even give a point off for that because really for the price point having it do two functions well seems unlikely.  The biggest negative point for my situation is that the dirt bin fills very fast  with fur and dust bunnies because it is so TINY and  the volumeof fur it finds is impressive. I am using it in a large living room and kitchen area of about 2000 sq. ft. The power is enough so that dirt and other small debris also is picked up however it was purchased especially to combat fur. In our household a scheduling mode would not be good because of the dirt bin size needing to be emptied during a run, it does need to be monitored and checked. However good for you if youdo not have pets or a large area and would not over fill the bin if it were running while you were away. I'd love a much larger version of this with a very big dust bin.Update: At just 5 months of use the Beetle started spinning, stopping after moving 2 feet and sounding as if the battery was winding down. Still hopeful over several weeks time I tried some recommended fixes.  All sensors cleaned off, bumper off, cleaned, re-installed, battery taken out and put back in, wheels removed and small fuzzies taken out. Nothing helps, it's officially not going to work anymore. I wanted to replace the battery on the chance it was that but -oh surprise! none for sale anywhere. Up until things went wrong I really thought it was a goodproduct.",3

It's low profile lets it navigate under my coffee table and around it's legs, so I no longer have to drag the coffee table around to vacuum underneath. My son named it Humphrey.  In retrospect, I would skip getting one with the mop function.  It does absolutely nothing.  I let it run for quite a while, and it still wasn't even getting the floor damp.  I had to run the cloth under the faucet and put it back on for it to do anything.  It may be effective for dust and allergy purposes.  The other part that I find aggravating is that it gets lost looking for home.  Twice in the past week, I've clicked home on the remote, and it went in the opposite direction and got lost.  I plan on getting another for another part of my house, but will skip the mop function.  Works better to let it keep the floor vacuumed and then go over it with a swiffer wetjet. Another thing, you can only schedule for one time during the day, that I can see, and it stays that time for every day.  I set mine for 0730, which was great.

This little guy misses a lot of spots or doesn't pick up items and passes it without getting the little crumbs. The navigation program is pretty horrendous. Secondly, it's not very mobile. It will hang on a raised elevation and just stick around that area without doing anything. Thirdly, It's quite loud, but that doesn't bother me too much but I'm sure someone cares about noise. Fourth, it doesn't go back to it's home after cleaning and charge up then start again. I have to find it, turn it off and walk it to its base. Fifth, the wood floor cleaner isn't very good. It just squirts water from behind the unit to a little cloth and smears water across the floors. I have wooden, non-carpeted floors.

Sirko","July 20, 2016","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",4,"I love my vacuum! The only reason this little guy didn't get 5 stars is because of his lack of mapping/memory technology-every day he gets stuck on my fireplace hearth. I arrange several small ottomans on top of it and our bot still finds a way to push his way between them and get stuck half on and half off the marble every time! I need to find something that works so if anyone has suggestions let me know! That is really my only complaint. I use him every single day while we get ready and I make breakfast to clean the edges of the rooms and then I set him to normal cleaning for a bit while we eat. Usually he covers all my rooms in that time-we have about 1200 sq foot on the first floor. Every night I have him vacuum our playroom-my dogs have their kennel in there so the hair is insane. I no longer notice a build up of hair at all. The mopping is okay-you have to wet the cloth well before applying it to get an even swipe of wet, otherwise it does two very small strips but never fully wets the cloth and it's useless. I've attached a photo of it mopping my laminate in the playroom with the pre-dampened cloth. Overall if you feel like efficiency and mapping is necessary for your space I wouldn't recommend this vacuum but for daily light cleaning on solid surfaces it is life changing and worth EVERY penny! I used to vacuum multiple times every day to keep the dust and hair from my dark wood floors and I honestly haven't had to pull my regular vacuum out once since I got this guy. My husband had bet me it wouldn't work as well as I thought and said he thought I was vacuuming with my regular vacuum when he wasn't home. Nope!",64

It won't go over my carpet because it believes it's an edge. I have to manually vacuum the portion with carpet.  If you have a dark carpet it won't transfer from tile to the carpet2. It seems to clog easily. I have ir set to run daily and wvwry morning I have to unclog the slit at the bottom when emptying the dust cage.3. It gets stuck on the tray I have my dogs water bowl on. It won't seem to tackle my carpet but goes into 4WD to brave the dog bowl tray. Doesn't make sense honestly. But I end up having to pull up the tray at night to make sure it doesn't get stuck every night.All in all this is one of the best purchases I've made. I have severe OCD when it comes to dog hair on my tioe floor. I found myself sweeping and vacuuming 4-5 times per day. This has changed everything. It works while I'm sleeping and then goes back to the charger so it'll be ready for the next night.",3

We call her ""Rosie,"" (like from the Jetsons) and she's a worker! She gathers a great amount of dirt and debris. We have a large family and my parents live on a farm- lots of dirt, grass, and whatnot gets tracked through these doors! No indoor pets, but a few long haired girls who seem to leave hair everywhere. Rosie goes after it all. This vacuum is not a complete replacement for your broom, but it certainly helps keep the floors clean, and is kind of fun to use to boot!Pros-Really sucks up the dirt! The dirt trap is always full- she definitely cleans!Fun to watch. There's just something entertaining about watching her zoom around the room.Great for between cleaning maintenance, or giving a once over while you're busy doing something else... Or just feeling lazy ;)Easy to use and clean. She *usually* finds her way back to her base when finished.Cons-Though the ""perimeter"" setting works fairly well, she doesn't always get close to convex corners. I'll usually send her around our island, and there is one place she never seems to get- she swings too wide on the turn.The spinning brushed do get tangled with hair sometimes, which is annoying, but it's not too difficult to clean out.The erratic cleaning pattern is effective, but sometime it seems it will clean all around a spot and misfit for several passed. Sometimes I get impatient and direct it to a certain spot, but that kind of defeats the purpose of a robot vacuum.It will get stuck under some furniture. Our coffee table has a brace at just the height of the machine. If she goes under at just the right angle, it presses enough to pop the top open and we have to close it. It's just barely too tall to clean under the end table.It does occasionally get lost looking for its dock, especially if it is blocked at all by furniture that is lined up with it.Overall, we are very happy with this little machine. Much cheaper than others on the market, and does a great job for the price.",3

I received the robot today, right out of the box I set it up and let her run. She ran for about 2 hours out of the box with no issues, she went under furniture, and over area rugs. I wish I took a picture of how much dirt was picked up. I honestly thought this type of vacuum would only pick up bigger particles, however when I opened the bin there was dog hair.. dust and very small particles... I was blown away and I am very pleased! Like honestly for the price you can’t go wrong. You can program your machine to clean at a certain time like the expensive counterpart. The machine is very powerful and has multiple settings which is awesome. & you can also mop!!! However the mopping feature isn’t to die for, it’s mostly meant for a touch up or quick wipe down. But still does a really good job. I would defiantly get this, especially if your single and not messy... set this baby to run when your not home and you’ll never have to clean again !!!",2

I have nothing to compare it to, this is my first robot vac. But I pick everything up off the floor, I set up barricades to keep it in certain rooms and away It goes.  It can go from my kitchen to the hallway over a raised marble divider easily and then onto a small rug and back off.  I think it cleans better on a hard floor than the carpet  because the sucking power is not as strong as  my regular vacuum but my floors are definitely clean when he’s done and he even gets the edges because his bristles stick out like little sweepers.  This is great if you have cat litter boxes and food dishes etc..  The mop feature: basically it just sprays a little water down as it goes and there is a pad attached that it drags along as it goes.  Surprisingly it does make a big difference because it goes over the floor so many times (depending on how long you let it run)  that it does make it significantly cleaner even with just water;  I sometimes spray water mixed with Lysol on the floor first.I’m pleased and hope it lasts!",2

Currently, I own Roomba and a Brava.  My upper floor is all carpet and my lower floor is all wood.  The Roomba vacuum sits too high to do an adequate job on the wood and I wanted something to vacuum ahead of the Brava mop.  That's where the ILIFE fits in.  It does much better at sweeping the small stuff off the floor.  It has a vacuum, but honestly, it's more of a sweeper that sends the dust and particles into the path of the small vacuum.  This is okay, it does the job and is MUCH MUCH quieter than one of the vacuums that boast powerful suction.  It is able to traverse over the throw rug I have in the living room and over a couple bumps I have (like cord conduits on the floor.)  It does a very good job of seeing walls and obstructions as it approaches them.  Unfortunately, it has a real bad habit of getting stuck.  I have it programmed to sweep just before I get home and more than half the time, I find it stuck somewhere.  It is fairly low to the ground, which lets it get into some tight spots that it can't quite get out of.  The mopping function is just dragging a cloth around while dribbling water onto the floor.  The cloth eventually gets wet enough to mop up dust, but not much more than that.",3

I was tired of it. I wanted to just enjoy my kids and not have to worry about cleaning their food mess every day!

I thought my days of cleaning every day were over but I was wrong. Bob worked well enough to where I only had to clean every other day but I still found myself having to go in with my Dyson so that he could mop. The mopping function is really weak, don’t expect this to actually clean much, it also puts out very little liquid. Regardless of his flaws, I loved him anyways. Every day I emptied his tank and was amazed at how much he’d pick up. He was a good little robot and he helped me out a lot. Then one day, less than a month from when we brought him home. He decided to have a stroke. His sensors went haywire and he would just bump into things and not change directions, he’d just stay there trying to go forward. Then he would just shut off and I couldn’t turn him back on unless I put him back to his base. Then randomly he just turned on and would not turn off, he was just vacuuming in place without moving, I had to shut him off with the switch on the side. R.I.P Bob. We’ll have to send him back where he came from. It’s a shame because I really wanted to love him but these hybrid robot mop vacuums have a long way to go until they are perfected because I’ve heard similar things from the Deebot.

I want a working one!!April 2017 - The instructions were hard to understand and it glossed over the mop feature so I have no idea how to make it work.  For that reason I am quite disappointed!

I love my first one so much that when I saw they had come out with a mopping model, I had to have it. This one is a bit taller than my other one but has more power and the tank that holds the hair/dirt is larger so it doesn't need to be cleaned as often. The mopping feature is awesome. It comes with a separate tank for water that you interchange with the regular capture tank and has a pad attachment that goes just sits in some holes on the bottom. Hit the button and off it goes! I recommend slightly wetting your mopping pad before attaching it to get a more even mop from the get go. The mop attachment is under the packing material in the box and I missed it at first so pull up all the packing to find it. It even game with extra bristles and an additional mop pad. The mop pad can be washed and reused so they should last a while or they do sell separate kits. Love the versatility of being able to use as just a vacuum or with the mopping. It does great on my tile and laminate flooring. My floors have never been cleaner and so much less stress for me with dog hair.",2
"49","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","Good unit, low price, but with some clear drawbacks","ANTHONY J GROSSO","June 6, 2017","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",3,"We had this for over a month now.  It works and does a good job of vacuuming and the battery life is pretty good.  I like the dust collection system, its large enough for my house and makes it pretty easy to clean and I continue to be surprised it what it collects every night while I'm sleeping.  But there are a few problems which make it a bit annoying and are what reduce its rating for me.I live in a single floor home, all wood floors.  I would guess about 8-900 sq/ft of continuous floor space.1. It can't reliably get over the edge of area rugs and either treats them as a wall or sometimes gets stuck.  The edge of the area rug is pretty standard and about a 1/2 inch.2. It can't reliably get over the thresholds between rooms.  Same as with rugs, but the thresholds are a bit larger and I've found the unit stuck on the threshold more than a few times when I woke up, only to discover it couldn't finish its job.3. It (often) can not find its home base charger.  This isn't that big of a deal, I just find the poor thing in the middle of the floor with a dead battery.  It was probably searching for hours...  To be fair, often it finds it, about less than half of the time, it gets lost.  I just pick it up and place it on the charger for the next night's shift.4. Its probably the most inefficient cleaning algorithm I've ever seen.  You can not watch it do its job.  It will drive you crazy.  I don't know who programmed it to make the choices it does when it hits something, but WOW its maddening to watch.  Sometimes, it'll go over the same spot a dozen times but never hit a spot just one foot away.  Having said that, I let it go at 3AM each night and when I wake up, it has usually cleaned the majority of the floor.  Done daily, it will keep the entire floor clean.All in all its a good unit.  Considering this was my first and I bought on price and features, I think I know what I would look for in the next one.  a) a unit that has a more efficient algorithm for cleaning and b) a unit that can jump over a 1/2 inch edge.",3

Fortunately it did not continue to tumble down the lower flight or that would have been the end of it.  I'm frankly amazed it survived the fall.  I guess that's impressive. Anyway, I have to baby proof my ledges for this thing because sooner or later, right about the time you start to feel like it knows what it's doing, down it will go.

Durocher","March 14, 2019","Size: V5s ProVerified Purchase",4,"I’ve wanted to try a robotic vacuum for a while but 3 things stopped me 1) all the toys on the floor constantly 2) worry the kids would break it 3) price.I’m especially reluctant of price because I don’t want to spend $300 on something my 2 yr old breaks in a month.  There are so many cheaper options with seemingly decent reviews on Amazon but I’m even more reluctant to try something without a brand or company to stand behind their product.  So when this was actually recommended by friends, had good reviews AND was on daily deal, I was drawn in.  Since I just purged our toys I thought a quick tidy would be enough to set it to work, so I went for it.Having never owned a robotic vacuum I am incredibly impressed with the suction of such a small device.  The all terrain wheels have easily gotten itself unstuck when it ran over the leg of a recliner or baby bouncer seat.  This really made me worry it would be jammed by a stray toy.  However it has not sucked up a single toy, it just pushes them out of the way.  It even manages to sweep under our train table and any stray toy under there it pushes out and I can just put it away.  The first time I started moving stuff I realized we have more than a couple obstacles but it goes around chairs and under tables.  It even manages corners well, totally unexpected.  He manages tile, hardwood, Berber carpet and 2 rugs seamlessly.Now the cons.  1, the dust cup is small but if I run it daily it stores enough to do our entire kitchen and family room without being emptied.  This includes cleaning up after 12 children and 1 rabbit.  2, I have 5 daughters, human hair is not the same as pet hair.  I swept twice a day usually and never noticed human hair really but it manages to twist around the spinning reacher arms.  I’m not sure how long before I’ll have to clean them off.  I will say it knocked a spool of thread off the table and got that tangled around an arm.  I learned that 1) if jammed it will turn itself off rather than break something and 2) the arms are so easy to remove and clean or untangle, though it does require a screwdriver (but who doesn’t have 1 conveniently in their junk drawer?).The “mopping” is basically an automatic wet jet so is really only going to work well on dust and superficial dirt, maybe a fresh spill.  But the time it saves me from sweeping gives me way more time to use my Shark liftaway steam mop.The battery life is great, over 2 hrs.  It docks itself when low.  It has a remote and can be programmed.  My kids prefer to just push the button.  The indicator lights tell you if the battery is low or the dust cup is full.I am now sold on robotic vacuums and want to get the one with a brushroll for my carpeted rooms so I don’t have to move this one back and forth (it can’t get over the step buttom of our baby gates).  I never realized how much time I spent sweeping until I was getting so many other things done instead.",NA

I have a German Shepherd and his hair is long and stiff, so it mostly clogs the opening of the collection bin and the basket stays pretty empty. It does better with the softer undercoat hairs and all other debris on the floors.  It even pulled out missing socks from under the couches!It worked well on my mom's hardwood floors--no pets there. After the unit completed the sweeping, I used the mop function and it did not leave much water on the surface. It dried in about 10 minutes.It does not 'map' the house as others mentioned so the movements seem pretty random. We also discovered the slower speed which is a lot quieter so my mom will use that one at night to avoid accidentally tripping on the unit during the day.  Her house also has a slightly elevated hallway and kitchen and the unit was able to ascend without too much trouble. It doesn't like thin, fluffy bathroom rugs but did OK with the rubber mat in front of the kitchen sink. We taped up some cords under the bed for the electic blanket so that the unit wouldn't get caught up with the cords. I have to buy some risers for the couch so it will fit underneath and not get stuck there.The unit is heavier than I was expecting and it has a light on the top so you can see it at night.  The bumpers on the front are springy when it hits the chair and table legs. It slows down when it senses a wall/door so it doesn't bang into those areas. She was happy to see how many crumbs and cornflakes it picked up in the kitchen. She can't easily bend down to get those items anymore. Hopefully, this will help her with her housework and provide entertainment so she can live independently in her home a few years longer.",NA
"57","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","Works well on bare floors, mopping feature is a great bonus.","Rahul A.","April 15, 2018","Size: V5s ProVerified Purchase",4,"I currently have a Roomba 650 that I use for the lower level of my apartment, and purchased the ILIFE V5s Pro for the smaller upper level since I got sick of lugging a vacuum up and down the stairs. The upper level is around half the size, so I couldn't justify the cost of a Roomba. After a bit of research, I found the ILIFE V5s Pro. At half the price, it's great value.The Roomba isn't the best comparison, given it's in a different price range, but here's how the two stack up:1. Navigation: the Roomba has onboard navigation, so while it might seem random it's actually very methodical. The ILIFE, on the other hand, is just random. The logic seems to be that if you let it run long enough, it'll cover every inch. It seems to work for small rooms, not sure how effective this would be for a larger area.2. Brushes: the ILIFE has the same two front brushes as the Roomba, but they seem better designed to my eye. The brushes are longer, so they capture dirt from corners much better. They are also angled inward (note that the brushes are marked L & R, and are not interchangeable), so that they feed the dirt to the vacuum, and don't just spread it around. The ILIFE doesn't have roller brushes on the underside, however, just a vent for the vacuum. This works fine on bare floors, but won't be effective on carpet.3. Docking: surprisingly, given the lack of onboard navigation, the ILIFE finds the docking station with relative ease. Better than my Roomba, which only finds it around 50% of the time.4. Mopping: not available on the Roomba. I was skeptical of the effectiveness of this feature, but was pleasantly surprised! It works excellently on bare floors, much better than the Swiffer I used to use. The mechanism is very simple - you fill a separate tank with water and install it, which then drips water onto a mopping attachment. The only negatives are that the water tank doesn't have a valve, so you need to make sure you install it fairly quickly or else you'll have drips all over. Also, the ILIFE doesn't recognize carpeted areas (unlike the iRobot Braava, for example), so you will need to roll up any rugs lying around.5. Dustbin: the main shortcoming of the Roomba is the round design of the dustbin. It's an odd shape, and it's very difficult to empty out, you always get dust flying everywhere. The ILIFE dustbin is a much better design than the Roomba. You basically lift out a square box (there's a nifty handle that folds out), and empty it into the trash can. There's also a handy brush provided, to make sure you get everything.6. Cliff sensors: the Roomba has extremely sensitive cliff sensors, they avoid stairs like the plague. The ILIFE doesn't have as effective cliff sensors, however. I would keep them away from the stairs, it's not worth the risk.In short, if you have a medium-sized floor area that isn't carpeted, the ILIFE does a perfect job at half the price of a Roomba. For larger floor areas or carpets, you will need to look at alternatives.",1

I kind of hesitate to get a robot vacuum cleaner since I think it’s fragile and expensive. Anyway so I decide to give it a try. This robot vaccum cleaner doesn’t require assembling and the moment it arrived it is ready to use. I charge it up first and use auto mode to sweep my hardwood floor, surprise, it picks up a lot of dirt and even hair. However, i hate picking hair off the sweeping brush. After removing the direct, I switch the tank and add water and the mopping part to start mopping. Cleans well and no problem. This robot cleaner is actually not heavy and but very strong. My son sit on top of it and it still able to clean and move around, even tho I do not recommend have kid sitting on it. However my son think of it as toy, so can’t help it. I just love the mopping part, even tho I wish they could come with more mopping part replacement. If only have the sweeper, hepa filter replacements. I have only try on hardwood floor, so I don’t know how well it work for carpet. One thing I hate about it it’s it look so much like a big toy and my sons keep going after it. It’s a hassle to have my kids to stay away from it. So if you have kids make sure have them stay away from it, otherwise floor won’t be clean. Since this robot cleaner with its sensor will back off if it gets near anything. This is a robotic Home assistant for me, works well. I hope the parts aren’t that expensive to replace.",1

We have all hardwood floors which is perfect for any robotic vacuum - however - our radiators and fridge are juuuuust a hair too far off the ground for the robot to sense the obstacle and instead, it tries to force itself underneath it resulting in it getting stuck and crying out for help. This is common for all brands of robotic vacuums, not just iLife and there are a few helpful articles around the Web about how to avoid this.Additionally, the robot has a difficult time navigating the house. I haven't quite figured out its algorithm yet, but so far it seems relatively random. Thankfully, the vacuum is so powerful that its travel path doesn't really matter too much. We only have to run it once-to-three-times a week for it to have an impact.Last note:  My roommates and I have long hair. The vacuum's brushes do NOT like long hair. Prepare to cut the hairs off of the brushes between uses or else the bristles get matted with it and eventually it deforms the brushes. I was able to re-shape the brushes back to their original stiffness, but it would have been a lot easier had I noticed the build-up sooner.",1

I wanted to make sure it would do what it said it would do and that I could trust it running without supervision.  It should be known that I have three cats and three medium sized dogs on hard wood floors.  This means that I have little piles of hair all over the floors and depending on weather a bit of dirt or mud too.  So my expectation of this product was this:  I want to come home to a house who's floors are clean and animal hair free.I notice a few things off the bat, that I have a couple places in my home where this little guy gets stuck.  It wedges itself under the dishwasher and under the kitchen table where it gets caught on a table leg.  The good news is when it gets stuck it just shuts itself off conserving the battery.  When I have been home I pretty much leave it alone and on the occasion I'll need to go rescue it from those few places it gets stuck.  I have however started letting it run when I'm away.  So far it seems to work with only one occasion where I've come home to it wedged under the dishwasher, but no big deal as it shuts itself off I simply un-wedged it and let it finish.  I don't think that's a big deal for me and I'm happy to let it run while I'm away as it's not an issue if it wedges itself once in a while.  It'll just finish the job when I get home.  I have spent too much time vacuuming the house every day for me to be upset that something that does it for me will finish the job late.  I'm not the one doing the work in the end and that leaves me feeling pretty good.The dust pan is a bit small in my opinion and it fills up after each run around the house (which it does go into all parts of the house which have doors open).  I empty the bin every day and it does its thing.  I'm okay with that.The mop on the other hand I'm not too happy with because it simply is a pad which soaks up water being dripped on it.  It does a fair light mopping I suppose but in a house with three medium sized dogs, its not good enough.  This is not affecting my score because I did not get this thing to mop (I thought it was a nice option though).In the end this thing frees me from 30 minutes a day of vacuuming (3.5 hours a week) and I'm really excited about that.  That's 3.5 hours I can put into cleaning more than the floors, 3.5 hours I can put toward playing with my daughter.  Hell, that's 3.5 hours of work I don't have to do.  I'm very happy and excited with his purchase.",NA

Hallquist","April 13, 2017","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",4," This little guy has definitely made my life easier. I have him cleaning the downstairs of my condo, which has wood floors throughout, and tile in the bathroom and kitchen. Overall, the first floor of my condo is about 700sq ft. I do have an area rug in my living room, and there are many obstacles for him to go around, such as a piano, coffee table, aquariums, telescope, etc. I also have three dogs and two cats, so there is plenty of hair everywhere. I will go through both the pros and cons of this nifty little robot.Pros:- First off, he does a great job of vacuuming the hard floors. I work full time and go to school full time, so house cleaning doesn’t get a whole lot of attention. (My house isn’t disgusting, I swear.) I cannot tell you how great it is to come home from a very long day, and walk in to find my floors clean. - This vacuum gets into the edges and corners better than I do when I have time to vacuum myself.- This picks up pretty much all the pet hair in my house, and has help my allergies a lot. The HEPA filter is easy to clean. The compartment that holds the dust and whatnot does need to be cleaned out every day, but that is easy.- He runs for a little over 2 hours before automatically returning to the charging base. The first few times, he did get stuck elsewhere, but that was because I was new to the robot vacuum and had things out that were hard to get around, or he went in a closet and couldn’t find his way out. 2 hours is plenty of time to get the floors clean.- I do have a slight rise between the wood floors and the tile in my kitchen (don’t get me started, I hate it.) He is able to go right over that without any problems at all.- Programming is super easy from the remote. Set it and forget it.- Surprisingly quiet.Cons:- Every once in a while, he gets stuck for no reason. The floor is wide open, and he acts like there is something in his way wherever he turns. This doesn’t happen often, but I have noticed it 2 or 3 times.- Don’t bother with the mopping feature. The water tank doesn’t drop enough water to keep the pad wet, and it just streaks a little water all over the place. It looks like a kid fingerpainted all over the floor with water. This isn’t a deal breaker for me, I don’t mind mopping every so often.Overall, I definitely recommend this. It does a great job of vacuuming, is very quiet, and it makes my life easier. Definitely buy this for the vacuuming, but don’t bother with the mopping. For the price, this is a great little robot, and will definitely help you keep your house cleaner.",8

I'm already ready to buy a new one even tho it's not even needed since my floors now actually stay clean for once haha. I wish they made these for carpet floors too!! I've used mine on the carpet floors and they do pick up stuff but I haven't really tested it completely, I rather just vacuum myself since my only carpeted areas are our bedrooms. Also don't let your kids touch it, that is my biggest pet peeve lol my son kept following it and opening it as it's running. But I got him to stop. My pets aren't bothered by it tho so that's good. It makes noise, but nothing to be extremely bothered about. I'm usually cleaning while I have it running anyways so it doesn't bother me. And if my son is watching tv, I just turn it up a bit.

I just let it run while I'm home and can listen for the ""beeps"" (that means it is stuck on something), go pick it up and let it continue to do its job.  I have watched it go over the same rug 5 times, then get stuck on it, on the 6th pass... Its all in how it decides to go across it that 6th time. I have also watched the thing try to vacuum up my foot and get stuck there until I kicked it off.  I haven't figured out its rhyme or reason to the way it decides where to go, but it does a fantastic job of getting the ""everyday"" dust and pet hair off my floors. I just have to keep an eye on it, and remove any cords or small objects off the floor before running it.  So if you don't mind keeping an eye on it, and letting it roam around the house and vacuum while you cook, its worth every penny! If you want something that you can set a timer on it and let it go while you are away, maybe spend the extra money and try something more expensive.",2

I loved it so much that I bought one for my son and talked my neighbor into getting one too. It was surprising how much dirt and dog hair it picks up. It is so easy to run it every day to keep the floors clean. It has no problem going over carpet, flooring or tile and only gets stuck once in a while. It can get under the beds, couches and chairs, where my upright vacuum never went. I love that it does not create dust flying through the air when it is on. It just sucks up the dirt. A couple of broken glasses in the kitchen were quickly picked up by this vacuum. I have used the mopping function twice. It is OK, but won’t get heavy stains up. For that, I use a regular mop. The robot mop function will work to keep some of the dirt at bay on the kitchen/family room tile. Otherwise, I run the vacuum every day, either downstairs or upstairs. What a time saver!

It is not perfect, but it is very good for the price.  The automatic shut off feature impresses me the most.  That is the main reason I am writing here.  Once the machine got wet, for whatever the reason, when you are not using the mop function, the machine will shut off on its own, and it will not charge or run until it is totally dry again.  The first time happened to me, I had it for a very short time, I thought the machine was bad, I even requested a return authorization.  Then I thought it might be just shut off on its own because it got wet when I noticed that my dog accidentally got the floor wet while the machine was plug in to charge.  I unplugged, let it sit for two three days, sure enough, it starts to work again.  Similar situations happened more than once, it comes back.  A few days ago,. I mopped with a hand mop, then the machine ran over the slightly damp kitchen, the same thing happened, I thought it is bad for real this time, after I tried to use it after a few days, nothing happened.  I turned it off all together, let it sit for days.  Today I gave it a last try, it works again!  So, do not write it off until you give enough time for the machine to dry if you do get it wet, so we don't throw a good machine away by accident.  I recommend this machine for everyone who needs light cleaning on a daily basis.  I have two dogs, I run it almost every day, it is still going.  In my opinion, the mop function of this machine does not get wet enough or cover the pattern like what I would want to clean the hardwood and tile floor.. But overall, I like it a lot, it picks up hair long and short, the house it is a lot cleaner.",1

As far as the controls, it doesn't have as many features as the Eufy.

I totally disagree! Some say it just sprays water on the floor and you have to mop behind it yourself, NO, you just have to let it run long enough to go around the room multiple times and it'll wipe it all off and even polish the floor. And without vacuuming, it runs for almost 3hrs (about 1hr40min when vacuuming). My large white glossy tile floor looks great. Obviously it cannot scrape or scrub dried food stuck on the floor etc, and the sprayer is in the middle of the machine, so it can't mop the last inch next to walls or cabinets, but I'm ok doing some spot-cleaning instead of mopping the whole house myself.",NA

(Updated)","Nina Halioris","May 1, 2017","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",5,"I've had this for not even a month and it's already been worth the measly $180. If this vacuum lasted another month, it'd still be worth it. We ended up naming ours R2-D2, we just call it R2. The scheduled clean goes off every single day right on time and is easy to set, I can leave R2 alone and it's always found it's way back to it's little dock. It runs for about an hour and a half to an hour and 50 minutes then drives itself back home.We have a cat and it takes care of cat hair, dust and little bits of litter tracked on the floor with no problem. The remote is cool, I didn't even realize the directional buttons on the remote can be used to steer the vacuum like an RC car. Mopping function is awesome, isolated it in the bathroom for about 15 minutes and the pad was atrocious. And I thought I kept these floors clean. R2 fits under all furniture and always manages to find little bits of dust and dirt carried in the house, it picks up candy wrappers, twist ties, etc. you could probably get away with emptying it every 2-3 runs, but I like to empty it when I get home every day so there is no loss of suction and I have OCD about it. The only thing I would say could be improved is the instruction manual. It helped me sort of get started but didn't really explain the different features and buttons, it was a very basic instruction booklet but the packaging was awesome and it came with an extra mop mad which we use one for the bathroom, one for the living area and we just toss them into the laundry and they're good as new. I let it mop for about 45-55 mins, which is about half battery life, then I switch the pads out ( since it conveniently came with two), then right in the wash with the rest of my laundry. The black connector for the mop pads comes on and off with ease and the plastic velcro is awesome and durable. It came with an extra set of the spinning brushes, which after a month of every day use (sometimes twice a day), the bristles are still perfectly in tact, not pulled out or frayed or even slightly worn. Comes with 3 filters, the initial one which after a few initial sessions, we had to change because it finds dirt where you wouldn't normally but two spare ones from then on. The filters are super easy to switch and last about 2 weeks depending on who you are and how dirty you live, all the parts seem to be made to change and switch out with ease and no wear down on the robot or parts. If your spinning brushes get hair tangled in them, just a quick unscrew with a cross tip and it pulls right off. The whole unit is easy to clean after about a week, you'll see a circular line where the spinning brushes rub the bottom of the vac but a damp rag to it, they wipe right off. Though it is quieter than any Dyson i've seen (which are very quiet vacuums), it is still a vacuum and it's still gonna make noise. We can hear the TV over it and talking on the phone with it running around you is no problem at all but if you plan to have it clean where you normally sleep, schedule it to clean during the day and not while you're sleeping because it will wake you. We changed ours from 3am to 10am because It beeps three times when it's leaving the dock and turning on and the motors make sounds and you can hear it wondering around the floor. Our cat was very uneasy about it the first few days but rarely even looks at it now.Remember this model is optimal for hard flooring only. Do not order this for your mostly carpeted home then come back on here and complain that your carpets are dirty. However I would definitely recommend this brand. You will NOT find a roomba that mops and vacuums. Roomba sells a robo mop and they sell robo vacs.----update----So for the mopping, i've partially filled the tank with water and i've used vinager once or twice, and I had a container of wet swiffer pads I had bought before R2, there was extra cleaning solution in the bottom of the container and I poured a little into R2's water tank, worked awesome. As a safety precaution per the manufacturers advice to use only water, liquidous very watery cleaners like vinager or pledge/windex multi-surface, or even your old squeezed out wet swiffer pads you don't need anymore work awesome and won't clog the drippers. The vacuum motor actually deactivates when you put the water tank in thanks to little magnets on the bot and water tank and it pretty much operates the way it does when it's going back to the dock, slowly and the brushes spin slower and it's very quiet because the vacuum motor is off. I'm elated iLife considered this when designing.As of now, about 2 months later, still just as happy with this brand entirely. If little R2 goes caput right after the warranty, I will absolutely be bying another from this manufacturer. You just look at the design of it and you can literally see how every part of it was thought out (with the exception of the manual, which is still even okay with me because it's fun just learning how the robot works because it is still after all, a robot). I haven't picked up neither a broom nor a swiffer since I got it.",9

It does work great. However, our little robot tends to fall down the stairs to our basement all the time; thus, it's only a matter of time before it is broken. As one might imagine, this will result in a couple hundred dollars flushed away for no good reason; therefore, I cannot in good faith give it anything more than two stars. I stated, it works great and it may be perfect for a household with no drop-offs / stairs, but for those homes that do have drop-off edges / stairs - beware. So, what is the problem? One might think that it's a sensor, but I don't think so (although I could still be wrong). See, the robot senses the drop, and it attempts to avoid the problem; however, as the robot backs away from the edge / drop it will then turn, in what appears to be an effort to move along, but continue with it's sweep along that top step. The real problem is when it goes to make it's turn, it isn't backed far enough from the edge / drop; thus, it turns and one wheel goes over the ledge. Often times this isn't enough to make the robot fall, but it will continually attempt to fix itself, and therefore it will inevitably fall to the bottom of the steps.",NA

Let me tell you we are extremely happy with this product, we use it almost everyday to vacuum/sweep the wood floors when we're home in the evening, it picks up most of the dirt and cat hair we have from our two tuxedo cats, my son is obsessed with using this robot vacuum and has become the official robot cleaner of our house, it works good on rugs in bedroom but not great, however it does a good enough job to hold you over until you need to pullout the real vacuum for your rugs, we also use the machine to mop our wood floors and are very happy with how it cleans our wood floors, irobot sells a cleaning solution on amazon that has a high rating but in the meantime we made up our own cleaning solution of water and a drop of vinegar, again it works good enough to hold us over to when we actually clean the wood floors with a dry mop once a week, the machine is easy to clean too, the one downfall I have with the machine is it doesn't always return itself to the charging dock and it's a good idea to be home when it's in use just to keep an eye on it in case it gets stuck and to empty the small removable bin that collects all the dust and dirt, all in all I would recommend this product one for how it cleans and mops and also for the price.

It senses obstacles and slows, and then follows the outline of the obstacle to go around and clean its perimeter. I cannot believe how much dust and dog hair this thing has collected in just one room! I think it is getting the dust from areas our many different cleaning devices cannot reach. The spinning outer brushes reach under objects and grab the lint and hair in cracks and crevasses. I think it is also sucking debris out of the spaces in the hardwood floors and tile. It loves to get under furniture and is determined to clean every inch. And it is so cute when it goes home to dock.I have used the mopping feature once now, and it is as you would expect - it is a light cleaning tool, and won't get the stuck-on messes. I loved it for the hardwood floor as it was just enough cleaning. For the kitchen, it will assist between heavy moppings.CONS - we have a very old house and many different levels of flooring and thresholds. It can go over some of these very readily. One or two of them completely flummox ""Dusty"" and stop him every time. What I learned to do was just put a stool sideways on the floor beside the high lip and let Dusty run. I have arranged my furniture to ensure that there is a Dusty-sized track so he can get around everywhere. And the recommendation to watch/ lift cords is accurate - it can get snagged on the cord.I just lift them so that they are not pooled on the floor surfaces.One might question whether it actually is a convenience device when you have to arrange the house to allow it to work, and the answer is YES! I have set the vacuum timer and it works. Picking up the cords and tucking them up once takes care of that, scooting the coffee table out two inches to ensure Dusty has a path is done, laying a stool on its side before I go to bed is a quick action and then  while I am sleeping, this little dude is sucking dirt from places I didn't even know had lurking dirt. It is going to be great for launching after a dinner party to pick up crumbs and just every night maintenance of the whole house. Life is good and I will no longer be breathing dust!",2

He doesn't seem to have much rhyme or reason in where he goes, which is fine for the vacuum feature. I have a house of hardwood floors, and he does well for the most part. He's gotten stuck a few times on area rugs, but he has a little beep to tell me he needs help, and then he goes off again on his merry, erratic way. He's small enough to get under most furniture, which is wonderful.If a particular area needs work, and he isn't up to the task on his own, there is a little remote which will direct him further. It's a little troublesome, the remote, as it has to be pointed at Charlie, and doesn't allow for much fine-tuning. I've found him light enough to pick up and plop down on top of or in front of a mess to let him do his thing.The controls could be a little better. He seems to always turn about 20 degrees or so at a time, which isn't the best if I'm aiming for a particular spot that's outside of that turn radius. And the edge feature (it follows the walls, etc...) only goes in one direction- to the right. I do wish I could tell him to stay going to the left, instead of maneuvering him into another spot and attempting again. He also seems to get bored of the edge feature and returns to his nonsensical ways after a minute or two.I have yet to use the mop function, but I'm very skeptical. I ideally want a more thorough mopping function than what seems to be Charlie's MO. I might end up just using him for spills or small areas I can control with the remote.Outside of his cleaning functionality, Charlie has provided me a lot of entertainment! He is fun to watch in his sporadic motions.",NA

I only use the ILife for its mopping capabilities.  The accessories are packaged really well and I love that I have extra pads because I run the machine daily.  I have tile floors exclusively throughout the entire house.  It does a good job of keeping up with the everyday dust and dirt but I don't consider it a true mop, it's more like an automatic wet Swiffer.  The water tank empties before the battery runs out, so if you catch it in time, you can re-wet the pad and/or add water to the reservoir mid-run.  Basically, the machine cleans well enough to allow me to do a thorough mopping with a real mop once a week mop or maybe every two weeks instead of every few days.  I don't trust this to run without being home because it does get stuck a lot more often on cords and curtains than my Roomba does.  It's much much quieter than my Roomba.  I have to go search it out sometimes to make sure it hasn't gotten stuck because I can't hear it running.  It's a good little machine for the price, but it's not going to scrub floors or be a miracle worker.UPDATE:  I've had this machine for over two months and I wish I had sent it back.  Compared to the Roomba, it's terrible.  It gets stuck EVERY SINGLE TIME it runs.  If you don't monitor it, it will just keep dripping water all over the place until you either get it unstuck, it runs out of water, or the battery dies.  It also has the weirdest cleaning patterns.  If this was my first experience with a robot cleaner, I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.  I haven't tried the Roomba mop cleaning robots, but I have a regular Roomba vacuum and it's much, much better.  I still give it two stars because it does keep the dust down if I run it and have time to monitor it, but it's not ideal.The other night I was sleeping and the machine just turned itself on and started to run through the room.  I thought maybe the cat sniffed it and set it off, so I put it back and it started itself again about two minutes later.  I finally just turned it off and took it off the charger so I could get some sleep.  It's a weird little machine.UPDATE:  I am changing my review to three stars because the customer service of this company is excellent.  They recently sent to me an upgraded model, which vacuums only.  It is a good little machine, but I purchased the ILife because of the mopping feature.  It's very quiet and vacuums pretty good.  I love how quiet the machine is.",18

Haven’t tested the mopping feature yet but it’s a nice bonus especially for the price and I will add a review on that feature later. Solid battery life. Pretty smart, we have a split level and there are no issues falling off landings (sorry for any reviewers who did :/)Cons: I said it’s smart...I didn’t say it’s a genius :) it does get stuck occasionally, but usually it’s common sense stuff, you left something on the floor or moved the furniture a bit fromwhen it did it’s original mapping. Just like your vaccumming might have limitations with wires and cord, a tricky throw rug, and stuff not where it’s supposed It will too. That said it can run unsupervised fine, especially if you set it up for success doing a little pre tidying (NOT pre cleaning) but I prefer running it while I’m lounging around. I rarely have to re direct it but it’s more for emotional support for my dog :) which leads me to my dog Kermit’s con, he’s afraid of it!Final note: Remember it requires maintenance and emptying! Empty after ever clean (or if your forgetful like me every other lo). Clean the filter and check the bristles after every few cleans. Again common sense stuff. You wouldn’t drive your car without maintenance and the time doing it is still drastically less then you spend cleaning.Seriously best investment I ever made.

I also have 4 boys ages 6 and under and he picks up their dirt and crumbs with ease. He will not pick up larger things (for example captain crunch berries). He will run for about 2 hours at a time before he needs a nap. The only reason I give him 4 stars is because he can be a turd sometimes, kind of like a bad little puppy that you have to keep getting onto over and over. He constantly tries to go under our couch and will either get stuck halfway under, or will get all the way under and then get stuck so we have to move the couch every time to get him out. (Luckily we can just easily slide our couch back and forth). You can also schedule times for him to run but I have not done that yet since I usually just run him at nap time and after my kids go to bed at night. I don't think he is loud at all really, we can hear the tv over him just fine.For our rugs it goes over them pretty smoothly. Our living room rug is a pain and doesn't stick to the floor very well so occasionally he will try to go over it and it will just push the rug up into a hill and he will get stuck, but not all the time.I have only tired the mopping feature once.

Nicknamed him Scoopy. Only had him a week and can't live without him.  He runs 1 to 2 hours a day. We have 4 dogs and 1 cat. Our home was constantly being vacuumed for fur and sand. Now only weekly will I take out the big machine. This little guys frees me up a good hour or more a day.  Now, I do empty his bin every 30 minutes, but that's due to the pet hair. I swear it falls out if the dogs every second.  No more puff balls along the edge of the hallway. Carpets are clean. He does get stuck occasionally, but I must say I am highly impressed by how well he navigates on his own.  Occasionally I will use the remote in the family room, but otherwise he does a fantastic job all in his own.  As to loudness, I easily watch TV while cooking in the kitchen while he is near. Better than kids running in the house playing.  Recommend for anyone with pets. I swear you will notice a difference in the air too.",1

Unfortunately, I wasn't happy and returned mine after the first use.I'm sure this robotic vacuum is great for people with very open floor plans and hardwood/tile/linoleum floors. It did well on my tiled kitchen--I didn't test out the mopping feature, but I'm sure it works fine.This vacuum SHOULD NOT be relied upon to clean carpet of any length, however. It simply isn't strong enough to suck up dirt and debris. I even poured a line of salt on the carpet's surface to test the vacuum. After a few passes, there was still salt on the surface of the carpet and visible to the naked eye.The navigation system worked poorly in my apartment, too. It would vacuum in haphazard streaks and miss large chunks of floor-space before moving to the next room. And don't ever let it get stuck between the legs of a chair. The robot's course-correction system seems to work at 90 degree angles. So if it bumps a leg, it will turn 90 degrees, completely miss the vector that will lead it back to open floor, and bump the other leg until it gives up and shuts off.As I said above, this vacuum is probably great for some people. But if you're needing it to clean carpet or map out a somewhat more than basic floorplan, I'd look elsewhere.",1

The thing about these things is you can't reasonably expect a robotic sweeper to clean an entire house in the 2 hours it runs.

It's like the kid you don't have. You can put it in a room and shut the door and come back in 30 minutes and it's actually clean. No it's not going to completely eliminate sweeping for you but it does reduce the frequency you will have to. It finds the dock pretty regularly depending on where it shuts off at. I've seen a lot of reviews about this being a bad product but I think they were expecting a little bit to much out of something that can't reasonably clean like that.

I've only had it a few days, so I can only comment up to this point.I bought this because regular vacuuming is kind of hard for me - it makes my back and shoulder really hurt, and my vacuum cleaner doesn't do a great job up against baseboards.  This thing solves both those problems.It was very easy to get working, and charged up fully in about 4 hours.  People aren't kidding about how quiet it is. You can easily have a conversation with it in the room, or hear the tv over it. It's not as loud as a standard vacuum by any means.  BUT, and this is huge, it's effectiveness at picking things up is much better than the noisy stand-up vacuum I have that cost just as much. I have two cats, so plenty of fur, dander and kitty litter, broken claws, etc.  I ran this little guy around for a while and the floor was nice and smooth. One cat was afraid of it, but not as wild-eyed ""holy crap get me out of here!"" afraid as he is of the noisier apparatus. And it's got an edge cleaning function that's really terrific; the little sweeper brushes that push things into the path of the suction piece are a bit wider than the machine so they have a good reach.I haven't yet used the 'mop' function, which is really just a kind of auto-drip water container with a washcloth section beneath it. So I'm not sure you're going to do a full spring cleaning type, suds and water kind of mopping-mopping, but for keeping a floor in decent condition I'm expecting it will work nicely.This is a really nice item for this price - if it lasts as much as a year I'll give it a 5th star :)",7

It does not come with invisible barriers so you have to put something in the way if you dont want it to go there. It slows down before wallbor furniture so it wont mess them up. The mop works ok.

It is amazing how much dirt is sucked up! We have cats and it picks up a lot of fur. Our kitties were wary of it for the first day, but they very quickly learned to ignore it. I have not yet tried to wet mop function or the timer.PROS: saves a lot of vacuuming time, I set it while I am doing other things in the house; relatively small, will go under furniture; you really can set it and (almost) forget it; remote is useful, makes it easy to control if needed; not that loud - like a small fan blowing in the background; charges quickly; lasts quite a while on one charge.CONS: You will need to let it do its job for at least 1/2 hour if you want ALL dirt picked up. Otherwise you will need to sweep a little bit after it is done (which is no big deal); the front sweepers brush debris around and then the vacuum moves around to pick up the debris, so there are some bits that get left behind; the dirt tank is pretty small, will need to be emptied more than once during an average cleaning (unless your floors are already very clean).It would be nice to have an ""invisible wall"" feature so it can avoid areas where I don't want it to go. Right now I simply put something large in its way to block off areas or I close doors, which works fine.I am glad I bought this because it does save me work on our hardwood floors.

It is scheduled to kick off while we are at work and done by the time we get home.  One thing to keep in mind is that it gets stuck easily.  You need to run it several times while home prior to scheduling it while away.  We needed to put thing under certain tables or chairs to prevent it from getting stuck.",1

I think some of the bad reviews are just people with the wrong expectations. Yes, you may have to empty him once or twice, especially in the beginning if you have not swept in a while. Yes, if you do not have a large enough space around the charging station or you have a lot of obstacles he may have difficulty returning on his own.  I have run Marty once a day, sometimes twice just because, and have not had to sweep myself in over a month! I thought he would just maintain throughout the week and then I would have to do some sweeping myself  once a week or so but no, Marty has kept up. There is ~1600 sqft that Marty cleans daily and he's been running for about 2.5-3 hours before returning to his charging station on his own. He does not seem to have trouble getting back even if he is in a different room. It may seem like he is going all over the place at random  but if you really pay attention there is a pattern...or ""method to his madness"" I have 2 large dogs and 2 cats that shed like crazy and he keeps up with all of it! Way better than I was doing with a broom and vacuum.  I do not have carpeting and I did put small lifts under my couch to raise it about a 1/2 inch. At first Marty kept getting stuck and had trouble navigating to his charger because the couch was just high enough that he could sense the charging station but just low enough that he had trouble getting under it. I have not tried the mop feature yet but I definitely recommend!!",5

If you want this for vacuuming, it is once again okay on hard floors, but not carpets.  There is no beater brush.  Other ILIFE vacuums have beater brushes and are designed to do better jobs on carpeting.  I have an IRobot Model 650.  I also have the ILIFE A4 (which has a beater brush).  For the price, the ILIFE does a decent job.  I would give the IROBOT a 4 star rating.  It has enough of its own shortfalls.  Some of its features can't be touched on the two ILIFE models that I have, but then again, I bought both of them for less than the cost of a single Roomba.  The invisible wall feature on the IRobot is very convenient.  Roomba does have excellent support.  I haven't had the need to use the ILIFE support.  Given my experience with both, I have no problem with and would purchase the ILIFE product again.  Just be certain that you are purchasing the one designed to do what you need it for the most.  I also forgot to mention that I have two German Shepherds who learned how to activate the ILIFE vacuums a lot faster than the Roomba.  I think they are amused by them.  They tried to get me to up my rating by offering a free kit,  I'm lowering it.  If this hits a chair leg, massive confusion.  Apparently the sensors are on the left and right side, not the middle.

Having two bulldogs that shed constantly it made perfect sense. So once we decided I went into research mode. After a week of research I decided to go with this product. Reason being it ranked number six out of all cleaners and the reviews that others gave it. Needless to say I was super excited when this little guy arrived. My husband go hit out and made sure to let him charge for 24 hours before using him. That next night he (I named him Jarvis) went to work flawlessly at 130 just like we scheduled him to do so. Woke up the next morning to no tiny dog hairs and Jarvis found his way back to his base to recharge for the next night. He worked great for the first two weeks. I was so happy with him. I hadn't had to dust mop dog hair in over two weeks. Jarvis had become my new best friend. I looked forward coming down every morning and seeing what he had picked up the night before.Well as you know it all good things come to an end. One morning I woke up and Jarvis hadn't done his job. I just assumed he didn't get back on his base properly and didn't charge. So I rearranged him on his base to charge for the next night. Came down the next morning and guess what poor Jarvis was DEAD!!!!! No juice. His base was no longer charging him. So I went online to amazon to exchange him and that was not an option just a return. Well I didn't want to return him I just wanted another that worked. So husband reached out to iLIfe in regards to the warranty. Called the number and go nowhere. Then he reached out to their Facebook page. Someone from there asked for our email and would contact us. That was ten days ago. Still no response and still a dead Jarvis. So I decided we would have to return him wait for refund and reorder. However my return date closed yesterday. JUST MY LUCK> Now I have a dead Jarvis and a company that will no respond to their 1yr warranty. So I've spent 200.00 bucks on a useless unit and an even more useless company.",6

The max setting helps but the regular setting will do just fine. Also you can control it with the remote so if there's one area you want done just drive it to there and send it back home.",NA

Also, on the vinyl floors the brushes trtend to launch anything the size of a small bead or more rather than suck it up.

Maybe it is for the best?","Vera","January 17, 2017","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",3,"I have been using it once-twice a week for about 2 months. I must say I was much more excited about it at the beginning.The technology is still far from perfect. It does pick up extra dust that you would otherwise miss - but it means you need to clean the filter (watch out for dust in your face) and replace filters often. The filter compartment is quite small so it fills up fast. Since we have a dog (medium size), there is always some dog hair on the floor. So i find it more efficient to do a first pass with Swifter (using thick paper towel) and then set the robot to pick up what i missed. However, since it moves in random fashion I never know when it covered the whole space. So i have to leave it running until it runs low/out of charge.Same with mopping. This feature is most important for me because alternative manual effort is much harder (carry bucket with water up and down stairs, scrub the floor hard, rinse and squeeze mop, etc). However, the robot does not scrub the floor, it just passes over it with a mop. It often gets stuck places which means i cannot leave him unattended on my wood floor as it will create a puddle. And IF the floor was not dusted 100% clean, the mop just spreads dirt around and i have to frequently engage with it: bend down, power it down,  remove the water tank, remove the mop attachment, all the time trying not to spill more water on the wood floor, wipe all the dirt robot left in its trace, and do the part i least like: rinse the mop cloth well. I do it in the sink, which means i have to clean the sink afterwards. I suppose i could buy a number of the mop clothes and run them through the washing machine but it seems like waste of energy and frankly i doubt it will last long enough for me to invest into a lot more mop clothes.I used to have iRobot Brava 380 for about 3 years. It was not any better. Also got stuck. Required constant babysitting. Washing the mop cloths. Cost a lot more money.Altogether this robot is an improvement.The design could be improved:1. replace random movement with some intelligence to save time and battery2. allow for use of standard mop clothes, preferably disposable thick paper towel pads, to reduce the need for washing them.",4

It keeps on running until I can only assume, the battery runs out of juice.

I have long hair and a long haired dog, So the roomba with the roller brushes was ALWAYS getting tangled with hair. This one has no roller brush. It cleans my hardwood floors and very low (vintage style viscose) carpets just fine. It only gets stuck somewhere occasionally. On thicker, more plush rugs, it doesn't really pick up the dog hair, so I still have to use a ""real"" vacuum on those. It is pretty good around the edges and I haven't noticed dust bunnies in the corners. I do have black floor vents that it won't go over (it thinks they are holes.) and it has trouble on a very graphic navy/white diamond pattern rug. I think it is the cliff sensors.I especially like the wet mop feature with the water reservoir. I just roll/fold the edges of the carpet up so it stays off the rugs when I have it set to do a wet wash. And the wet mop is awesome in the bathroom. I just close it in there and come back in an hour to a nice clean floor.

However, my cleaning standards are low. With that in mind, here is my review.We bought a house with wood floors (our first, I was soooo excited) & we have a dog (who sheds more than I ever noticed). These two things do not go well together. From day one I was chasing fur tufts, and losing the battle. After 6 months of this frustration, I decided to bite the bullet and buy a Roomba. While doing my due diligence (aka, research), I found this little gem at a TON less money. I wondered what I would be sacrificing, then I decided I'd try the ""cheap"" version first & it it worked out, I'd buy the top of the line model.I will NOT be buying a Roomba any time soon, because you don't need to spend that much to get what I needed. This is perfect. It gets ALL of the dog fur (& cat fur too), and all the dust that I didn't even know was there. I am constantly amazed at what I empty from it's little receptacle.So - how good does it clean? Picture a DustBuster. That's the extent of what it can pick up. But THIS DustBuster operates on its own & goes places that the original could never get to (i.e., under the couch, etc.)What about carpets? Don't get rid of your Hoover!Is it efficient? Nope, not by a long shot, but who cares - it takes care of itself.How long does it run? I've let it go as long as 2 hours on a single charge.Does it get stuck? All the time & usually on things that haven't proven a problem before. Don't run it without some supervision.As for the mopping feature - pay the extra $20. Seriously. It's only as effective as a wet paper towel going over a spot on the floor - but then, that's more than I do for mopping & it does the whole floor.My wood floors actually gleam now; I don't know why - I've only mopped twice in the past three weeks, but they do.As for tile floors, for some strange reason, it's not quite as good. Maybe I've never had the patience to trap the thing in the bathroom long enough, or maybe the slightly indented caulk lines affected it. I don't really care. I takes care of the hardwood floors (& area rugs) clean enough for me & I am one happy camper.",6

First run worked great, but it did not find the charging base which was on a wall, wide open, thought that was odd. The bin is REALLY small so it had to be emptied several times. All the fuzz was stuck around the opening vent so I am not sure about the suctioning power. You can't just empty the bin, you have to clean around the whole thing. I was disappointed at how cheap the plastic parts were, Ifelt like I had to be really delicately careful, I was afraid about breaking them. Still, I was ok with the purchase considering. But then the biggest disappointment was the second time i tried to use it. It sat in the middle of the floor and beeped at me. I owned several roombas over the past 20 years  So I know it can be a matter of not putting the parts in correctly or cleaning out the brushes. So even though it was only my 2nd time using it I carefully cleaned all the brushes and put the parts back in place.  This did not fix the problem.

"450","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","Don't want to think of how dirty my floors were before...","Kate","January 6, 2017","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",5,"I'm very happy with this purchase. I recently started dog boarding in my home for a little extra money and did not have time for the upkeep of daily sweeping. Enter ILIFE V5s (or Sharon, after my favorite cylon...)I bought it a couple months ago and I run it every day - the difference it makes! Even when I don't have a dog around, I'm surprised/impressed with how much it picks up when I had only run it a day earlier. I hate to think now how dirty/dusty my house was before this purchase.Few issues-When it squeezes into tight spaces, sometimes this causes the top to become disengaged from the closure and it pops open. Not a big deal, given that the robot almost exclusively moves forward, this happening does not seem to have caused it to get stuck or damaged it at all. I simply push it back it and it goes about its business.-I have two 8x10 carpets on my lower level. The one in my dining room is about 1/2 an inch thick and has backing. The ILIFE has no issue clearing the edges and vacuuming the carpet. The living room carpet however, is very thin, about a 1/4 inch with no backing. 60% of the time, the vacuum can't clear the edges and just pushes the carpet up a bit before turning to vacuum somewhere else. I intend to get a rug pad for that room and I don't anticipate it having issues after that.I've only used the mopping feature once, but it works well! I wouldn't leave it monitored when mopping, however, and you can't schedule it to mop, which is a good thing. If it got stuck, it would keep dripping water and you'd end up with a puddle or malfunctioning robot from sitting in water all day.No major complaints. The dust bin is small, like all robotic vacuums, so I'll empty it occasionally in the middle of cleaning. The English translation on the instructions is a bit off, but still easily understandable. You really can't beat it for the price.",2

I've had it for 3 weeks now and used it quite a  bit since its arrival. I live in a single level apartment, 5 room apt, about 750+ SqFt with 89% bare floors, three area rugs, and no pets.  We call ours Zac the Vac.The first time Zac picked up a tremendous amount of debris off the floor, however he has a random movement pattern and as a result goes over and over the same places multiple times, while missing other areas completely.  I had to manually guide him on a few occasions to cover missed areas.  Zac seemed to be trying to escape my apt as it kept going over to the balcony door repeatedly.I used Zac on the same low pile area rugs over multiple days and he left large and small debris behind each time, in both the regular and the max power modes.I put Zac in edge to edge mode, but he didn't do all of the perimeters. Again I had to manually guide him to help it stay on the perimeter.I tried to set it for a scheduled clean one day to come home and find it didn't do anything.  The manual says if you don't hear the beep it didn't set. I don't remember if I heard the beep or not, so I'll chalk that one up to user error.  I tried again while I was home.  It kept beeping, but didn't run on the schedule, so I tried to set it again and finally it ran undisturbed for almost 2 hours!  Zac picked up a significant amount of debris considering it just ran yesterday and the day before.  Not as much as day one, but slightly more than day two.Zac couldn't find or make his way back to his base on multiple occasions. The first time the battery died after about an hour of mixed power use and it didn't find the base before dying in the middle of the floor.  Another time I had to manually guide him back to the base.  On day three I let it go on its own to see what would happen.  It got close and turned away because of an obstruction then went far away from the base and got tangled on a cord and died.The battery lasted about 90 minutes to almost 2 hours (as indicated) in low power mode in scheduled mode before being exhausted which I thought was pretty impressive .  I also closed off two rooms to limit access and focus more on the outer areas.  Zac ran over cords under my entertainment center.  The cords got tangled in the wheels and sweepers and took some time to untangle, but I eventually fixed it and it began running smoothly again.Zac also has slightly higher lip in the front than on the back which prevents him from going under some of my furniture.  I've seen other units where it is completely level all the way around.  As a result he can't go under my coffee table or couch.A few times since the reviews above, it's gotten stuck under chairs, on my area rug and tangled in cords again.  Zac still picks up quite a bit and does a good job.  Even for a basic model without a lot of bells and whistles, my floors look great and have never been this consistently clean.  Based on the other uses who had problems, I brought the warranty so if in the end it only lasts a few months I'll either get a replacement or upgrade to a better model/brand.  If I do upgrade, I definitely want a model that has more flexibility in scheduling.  This one only has a single schedule setting, which means it will run every day of the week at the same time provided the scheduled setting is turned on.  I don't want to use it every day out of fear of wearing it out faster, but remembering to turn it on and off and reset the timer is more hassle than its worth.UPDATE - Using the wet mop feature now.  It's been running for almost an hour in a closed off room and I have yet to see any water on the floor although the mop head is damp.  I was hoping it could do a damp mop in addition to the vacuuming, which is still pretty impressive, but I don't see this as being the case.  I'm going to let it run until the water runs out or the battery dies, whichever comes first.  I lowered my rating because I bought the unit for both features and it appears I'm only getting good use out of the dry mop.",1

My robot broke after a couple months of regular use. I arrived home one day to find the sensor bar must have gotten stuck somewhere as it was hanging off the unit. I contacted customer support who asked me to send it back with tracking and they would either refund or replace the unit. Unfortunately I was not able to provide tracking, as the receipt was misplaced during a cross country move. It seems whoever I was corresponding with is overseas, and the unit was shipped back to California. I've written several emails asking for follow up and have not gotten a response. At this time I'm still out the full cost of the unit and have nothing to show for it, and I'm incredibly disappointed. I loved this and was hoping to have one for our new home with all hardwood. Really bummed I spent all that money for nothing. ***LOVE THIS.  Works great on our hardwood for all of the cat hair tumbleweeds, and navigates pretty easily over the throw rugs as well.",9

The other brands are way too expensive...So I am happy to say, WE LOVE IT.  It does have some issues going back to 'home base' and finding it and a few training issues with going around corners...but the fact that you can program this and we do, we have it run every morning at 9a.  I just have to go in and check to make sure it didn't get stuck anywhere (due to my thicker carpet in family room etc)..Our home is mostly all time and wood floor, but much to our surprise we used this in our carpeted rooms and garage and it worked AWESOME.  We had to empty the tank twice from the carpeted garage since we didn't realize it was so good, we had massive dog hair that we couldn't even see until we emptied the tank.  The mopping is ""ok"" once you get it going....probably best for just 'spot mopping' but again, this thing works wonders for our home and we have a black lab (white tile) so it's been a great tool for us to keep up with her shedding this year and this has worked great.  We are buying another one for the lower level of our home that will do the bedrooms and it goes under the beds just fine.

This is the single worst thing I have ever purchased. If you want a vacuum that you simply must baby sit the ENTIRE time its on, then by goly this machine is for you. I have hardwood floors and bought this to help me out with dog hair. This thing could not handle vacuuming for less than 5 minutes before stopping because the brushes had hair stuck on them and you needed to remove them. This happened 6 times in an hour. No joke. It also did a very poor job at actually cleaning. Most of the dog hair (I have a French Bulldog) was still there 2 hrs into “cleaning”.This vacuum is also not very smart. It pactically ate my laptop cable as well as my iphone charger and had I not noticed, it would have. I had to turn it off and release the cables from it.In comparison to the Roomba 630 which is not much more than this one and you can control it with your phone; the Roomba wins hands down. I bought it to replace this one as I returned it after two days of having it. The Roomba is intelligent. When it senses cables or other obstacles, it doesn’t try to “mount” them, it simply moves on to a different spot.The mop feature is a horrific joke. It does NOT work. First off, when you put water into the designated mop box it doesn’t stop leaking until you put it in the vacuum, in other words its CHEAP. The mop attachment which you’re suppose to click onto the vacuum in order for it to absorb the liquid and make the surface smooth, never clicked into place and I was unable to put it on. Three different people tried this to no avail.This thing is cheaply made. Trust me. Not to mention the instructions are in poor English and you can tell this whole device is some crappy Chinese contraption.I have never left a bad review in my life but I simply have to warn others not to spend their hard earned money on this thing.Do yourself a favor and buy the cheap Roomba 630 like I did. It does an amazing job, especially when compared to this vacuum. By the time you buy this and return it (which cost me around $100 to do) you will have spend more money on this than on the Roomba. I find it inexplicable that this machine has such high ratings on amazon (which was the only reason why I bought it). I’m sure the Russian bots that got Trump elected got together with Chinese ones to make fake accounts and review this highly.Its the only explanation!DO NOT BUY!",1

This is the first robot vacuum we have ever owned.2. We only use this for our hard surface floors (hardwood, laminate, tile and some rug) on the first floor of our home.3. We never used the mop function, since we have rugs on top of our hardwood floors.4. We are very tidy and can't stand crumbs and dust anywhere in the home5. We have 2 little children that leaves crumbs everywhere in the homeTired of sweeping and vacuuming everyday, we looked around for a robot vacuum cleaner. After reading lots of review and doing price comparisons, we settled on the ILIFE V5s. This robot, which we named, ""Wally"", is a life saver! It not only did a wonderful job eliminating our daily vacuuming and sweeping choirs, it also cleaned areas we don't usually get to (under dining table, computer desk and sofa). We are very happy with our purchase and being able to remove vacuuming and sweeping off our daily to-dos, all at a fraction of what other robots costs.I will point out that what others have said about the robot getting stuck on wedges is true. We have a couple of bar stools in the kitchen with a pedestal base where the robot would climb and often get stuck. Since the robot navigates by sensors and actually map out your floor plan, it will go to the same place and get stuck from time to time. This is a minor annoyance and easy resolved by moving the chairs.I also want to point out that the customer service is top notch. We had owned the robot for almost 6 months before experiencing an issue with the front wheel coming off. Within a few hours of contacting their customer service we got a response and the representative worked quickly to resolve our issue. They decided it was best to ship us a new unit and provided the shipping label to return the old one. We received the new unit within 3 days. I am so satisfied with my decision to purchase this product and with this company!",2

So I got this easier to afford ILIFE and am pretty satisfied. Note, my house is mainly laminate floors, almost no rugs, and thresholds. The machine does good job picking up crumbs, particles, dust, and cat litter. The mopping feature is convenient too, I'd rather call it wiping feature though. Easy to operate, the battery lasts for several hours, enough for two mopping refills. Other points: is not effective on the rugs as much, gets stuck or can not untangle or back off from wires, soft rugs, or other bumps if higher than .5 inch.

"672","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","Decent carpet sweeper only","Review Girl","September 28, 2016","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",2,"Vacuum is decent but only for a carpet sweeping effect. Not to replace regular vacuuming, but in between regular vacuums. It rolled right off the top stair almost as soon as I started it for the first time. It seems to have no sense of where it has already cleaned - misses entire large areas but repeats the same smaller spaces such as around the dining room table and chairs (getting stuck frequently). The two brushes at the front left and right sides rotate to gently push smaller debris in front of the small suction area.It  has a very small dust bin and must be emptied frequently during cycles. However, if you need very gentle cleaning on carpet and hard floors it can save some time and effort. I felt kind of like I had to babysit the machine while it was roaming around aimlessly. I definitely had to keep turning it around when it wanted to get hung up in the same corner.The mopping feature is nearly useless. The water compartment is designed to slowly drip onto the floor. (Cloth pad wipes up the dribbles.) This means it is impossible to keep it from dripping while you fill the tank and put it in the machine. Filling and starting mop mode is a mess! Yet, the water doesn't drip heavily enough to actually mop with any effectiveness. I can tell by the pattern of dirty residue that collects on pad that most of it doesn't touch the floor at all. The only reason I use the mop feature is to ""spot clean"" and even then I still have to get the Swiffer Wet Jet to wipe what's left. Also, the instruction manual is poorly translated. Not helpful.Bottom line: If you're pressed for time and have company on the way over, or just like a light sweep between vacuuming then this machine is your friend. It is also very quiet. I find it somewhat useful and for the price it's worth keeping around. Had I known ahead of time, I would have spent the extra money to get a name brand machine instead of this one.",7

WRONG!!!!  This is the gift that keeps on giving!After seeing how clean the floors were at my son's home, (who has 2 active dogs) and knowing his usual effort and time used for such a thing, I was impressed and curious.  (surely he must have hired someone... hahaha) Upon entering his bedroom I saw THE MAID,  there was his iLife V5s, turned into a Big Hero Six Baymax, via a sticker, busily cleaning the floor.  That was enough for me!My Gift arrived 3 days ago, since then it has cleaned the great room, the kitchen, the master bedroom, vanity and bath, twice.  Once while I worked, once while I slept.  The floors look great.  Dog kibble, dog hair ( of which there is a lot daily), crumbs, sand from the beach and most impressively, dust all removed.  Each time 'Benny the Beetle' ran out of juice, he returned to the docking station.  This is THE GIFT everyone should ask for!I have no idea the life expectancy, but apparently my son has had one for a long time, therefore I have hope!  Bottom line, I love it, my husband is impressed and well, my 95 pound shedding dog wants to either attack it or play with it...

Since most of our main floor is now wood and tile, I figured it was time to try it.  I was not aware that there is a wet mop model that has a water tank, so when I found out, my wife and I were excited to try it out.  We have light-colored tile in the kitchen that seems to show off every tiny spill or speck of dirt.  It was great to be able to set this thing loose and not feel like we have to manually mop every few days!  Worked as advertised!  And it does a great job on the wood floors too as long as the floor is free of magazines, clothing, etc. that it might get caught up in.  But the best thing is to watch how our dog responds to ""Ringo"" (as we've named this ""Beatles-branded"" robot).  Our standard poodle, though much larger and stronger than Ringo, is extremely cautious of the new resident in our front hallway.  It is hilarious watching as he tries to make friends with Ringo, but Ringo just goes about on his merry way doing his job, and doing it well.",3

They have a cabin with tile and painted cement floors.  It was easy to set-up, and after charging, the robot was put to work.  It excels at picking up animal hair and dust.  It didn't pick up all heavier dirt, such as sand, on the first pass, but by the time it was done working the floor is very clean and the dust bin is full.  It has only been in use for two weeks, but has been run about 8 times, and so far, no problems.  It is also very quiet, as others have mentioned, it is no problem to watch tv in the same room while the robot is running.  I have not used the mopping feature yet.  So far, very happy with this purchase.It runs for about 165 minutes before needing to charge.Takes about 4 hours to charge.Updated review:  After 18 months of use, I continue to be impressed with the robot vacuum.

So before purchasing one for our selves, we wanted to see how well they worked. They loved it. So we were very excited when we saw the price of this one, and we purchased it. Our excitement went out the window 2 weeks down the road. Our problems began with the timer, schedule we set for it. We replaced batteries 3 times in a 2 week period. Our floors have no carpet so we thought this would be a plus for this mop / vacuum device. Mop part of it never put water on floor while cleaning when system was switched over. The vacuum part work's very little, doesn't pick up as stated. It gets stuck a lot and has a hard time going over small thresholds. The sensor in the front doesn't seem to sense what it's about to run into and will get stuck in corners very easily. Plus it can never find it's way back to base, as it states. I have to pick it up and return it . This was a Christmas gift, but received it in January. We went from being very happy with it, only to find out 2 weeks later it wasn't worth the money for the very short time having it.

Below are a few answers to questions and best practices that helped me achieve maximum efficacy with my ILIFE Model:V5s- Keep your floors clear of wires or tuck them along the wall.- Yes, the vacuum works great on both hard floors and seamlessly transitions to carpeting.- don't hide the base station, your only making it harder on yourself.- Keep your shoelaces tucked in your shoes, otherwise, the bristles will suck them up and the vacuum with stop- If you have a small floor mat, welcome mat, bathroom rug or any small standing rug tape them down. Otherwise, the bristles can get under the rug and you will find it in a new location when you get home.- Rugs that have patterns, specifical black colors may trip the ""cliff sensing"" detectors. can be annoying.- Do not use exceptionally soapy water with the wet floor cleaning mode, I've seen the wheels unable to grip the floor and spin out.- If the vacuum seems to stop sucking things up, it's time to empty the dustpan.- Yes, you will need to do a few test runs in your home to determine what you might need to move or change in order to prevent the vacuum from stalling.*** Forgot to mention, the customer server is EXCELLENT! My Vacuum had an issue so I reached out to the ILIFE team for advice and they were exceptionally responsive.Shoutout to ILIFE-Tony for all the help, Thanks Again!!!",1

My iRobot bit the dust (hahaha), so I decided to try this one.  It's ok.  It gets stuck, every time I run it.  My other one got stuck 1 out of every 30 operations.  It's also much more difficult to empty the dirt than the iRobot and has a smaller compartment for dirt.  The moping is pretty silly, for the price I may buy the sweeper only version, but if I had to do it all over again I'd skip this version with the mop, I'll likely just keep it on sweep mode only.",1

So to use it, we have to remove all rugs, and make a border on the floor using barstools tipped on their side so it doesn't go into the living room and stays on our wood floors. Sometimes it goes back home. Most times it just dies someplace and we have to find it and put it back on the charger. Haven't tried the wet feature. It does pick up a surprising amount of dog hair from our wood floors, which is why we purchased it. It's OK. Just keep your expectations low and know you have to rearrange furniture before and after using it.",1
"784","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","Robbie is great. We love him.","LizRob","January 5, 2017","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",5,"I LOVE this little guy!! I have named him Robbie (very original, I know). I want to buy some stick-on googly eyes for him... would be so funny because his sweepers look like little arms.I have not tried the mop option, will update review later when I have.I bought him to keep the floors clean because I'm a busy business owner and also a bit lazy when it comes to cleaning. Ha. I figured at least Robbie could keep it somewhat clean between bigger cleanings.If you have pets, the little canister can fill up quickly but once he's cleaned it is easier to maintain. Robbie even picked up a mini snickers wrapper from under the couch. Oopsie? Thanks Robbie :)My home is pretty big and has a weird layout but Robbie has no problem navigating through the entire house. I even had to block off areas I wasn't yet ready for him to enter. He does not go in an orderly fashion, as another reviewer said -- he roams through the room (in a heuristic type way just bumping into things -- Robbie's a little special always bumping into stuff but we still love him and he does a good job.) He goes around outsides first and then the insides in no particular order. But he always goes over the areas multiple times, so once he's done it's mostly clean. He does miss some spots sometimes, but the remote is helpful for that. I pretty much just let him do his thing and I am very pleased.He's found his way around my curved fireplace, a dog kennel, couches, oven, dishwasher and kitchen table -- and even cleans around a weird column I have in the middle of my living room.I do not have stairs so cannot attest to whether or not he is good with them. He seems to slow down around certain items and others not so much. Haven't figured out why.He has no troubles going under the bed and couch and making it over rugs in my bedroom and bathroom (some are heavier rugs. lighter rugs or rugs that move easily already have rug tape under them.)Robbie has only been stuck a few times. Haven't we all, though.  He got stuck under my couch (NOT HIS FAULT) because I live in an old house and the floors are uneven -- so he can only fit under the couch in certain areas. He has also been stuck on my bathroom rug but most of the time can go over it or smooth himself out along the way. I think that rug could use some rug tape anyway.He only has a little trouble getting back to home base when he is in a whole other part of the house. It seems like he has to circle all the rooms again and suffer while he's dying in order to find his home base.  Robbie is so emo. I've had to help him find it with the remote only one time so far.The only thing I was slightly disappointed about was his little sweeper arms came all weird and bent on some of the arms like other reviewers have said -- but once he is on the floor and sweeping it doesn't really seem to matter too much and they kind of flatten out. He will fling some debris around sometimes but then vacuum it up.. like he's moving it to a better position to suck it up.All in all, I love Robbie, and am very happy with the price point and product.",1

I have tried to get the scheduler to work but it only worked one time and hasn't since. It still shows that it should run but nothing. It also gets stuck under my kitchen cabinets so if we aren't home it will run until it shuts off. I don't know how to have it avoid the areas where it gets stuck. We also have a chair that it gets stuck in another room. Based on these two issues I am considering returning this unit. It is gentle and hasn't marred my cabinets like a prior brand did. My main reason to have this was so it can work when we aren't home and we come home to a vacuumed house. If I could have the scheduler work and have it not get stuck I would keep.

It seemed like it did a good job of picking up copious amounts of pet hair and dirt, which was what it was purchased for.Fast forward about a month and a half of sporadic use, and the thing as a hard time turning on, and if/when we can get it to turn on, it will run until the sensor identified something, and instead of turning in a different direction, it just stops its process, blinks its lights, and turns off.  Once we get it back to the charger, and hope that it will be able to be restarted, we go through the same process.Unfortunately, this began after the 30 day return window, or it would be getting replaced with a different brand/manufacture.  I have reached out via email to the company, and hope to hear back soon to see what our options for replacement/repair are.

I figured out that he did a fairly good job at damp mopping as well if you dampen the cloth in hot water first before attaching. Good for dustmopping not so much for cleaning the floor thoroughly. Unfortunately I had to return him because our home is very open and due to the fact that he doesn’t have a ceiling sensor or the like he seemed to get confused as to where he’d already cleaned and hadn’t. If I put him in a bedroom and shut the door he went to town and did a great job!I will give the customer service a 5 star rating as they responded immediately and refunded my money as soon as I delivered it with the prepaid return label they provided.

I don't use the setting to run while I""m gone, I just turn it on  every evening while I'm cooking dinner and let it go around the whole house on main areas and then it will find it's way back to dock when runs low on battery, or I turn it off and put it back on dock.

I haven't tried others, I went on other reviews and picked this one because it cleaned well, was supposedly quiet and wasn't so expensive that i would be really upset if my kid broke it. I love it. The vacuum is great. It is not a smart machine and can go over the same area repeatedly and miss others. so i just leave it on forever while i do other chores or relax. we have a loft like space so when i want a specific area cleaned more thoroughly, i put it in the bathroom and close the door or lay chairs on the floor to block it in the kitchen. the mop is ok. it does a good job in the bathroom and bedroom but doesn't do well in big areas.

When we thought ours was broken, we were surprised at how much we had been relying on it. I work remotely, and so I'm able to police it since it does tend to get stuck when doing its rounds. It does a great job though - I just feel like I have to remove a star since we can't program it to run while we're away because it would inevitably end up stuck and stalled each time.But for the money: the handy remote, the mopping feature, the extra brushes and the quick service replies make this a no-brainer purchase!",NA

Initially I used it daily and I was amazaed at how much dust and crud can be found in just a single day.  And then I went for about three weeks without using it and now it seems confused. When I press the ""clean"" button, it just backs up out of the charging base and spins around backwards in circles.  Then is takes off as if it is about to begin cleaning.  It goes about a foot or so and then goes into what appears to be home mode.  But it never finds home base.  Even though it is only a foot or so away from it.  I am hoping to figure out if I need to reset it or something, because this little vacuum is amazing!  It is too good of a vacuum to let gather dust!  Yes I said it.  Weak pun...This problem has since been corrected via some help from their tech support team.  It simply had gotten one side of the bumper stuck when it got stuck under a cabinet where there was some carpet nearby and it took me about five minute to fix after they sent me a video of how to correct.

That is what I did different than the instructions and it is working wonderfully!  It beeps in the beginning, but then begins charging when the lights start flashing.  The lights will remain solid blue when fully charged.  If this continues to work so well I will upgrade to 5 star and order another one.I raised my stars to 3 and may raise it to 5 if the iLife continues to work as good as it is now.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!  I only gave it one star because there was nothing less.  All this company from China wants is your money and they don't care about a working product.  Don't buy their junk!!!Woked great the first day.  Never could get it to re-charge after the first day.  Sent it back.  Is this normal?  Is this a common problem?  I want to order another one if I just got a lemon.  Please share honest (not the paid responses) experiences.UPDATE: They sent me a new one and after 24 hours it wouldn't charge, again.  Their customer service is somewhere overseas and they ask you to send a video of the problem and when one of their techs has time to watch it they will search for a solution.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!  iRobot had on the spot customer service and they wouldn't hang up until the matter was solved.  I'm going back to iRobot and their Braavo and hope they come out with a new scooba soon.  I have had 100's of responses having the same problem with this ILife.  Most stated it didn't work after a day or two and not one had a positive experience with ILife's customer service.  Sorry, I wanted to love this new company.  There is certainly something wrong with their electrical system in the ones being sold at this time.  I suggest not wasting your money.FINAL UPDATE:  My ILIFE V5s is a month old and has completely stopped working.  The PLASTIC hinges cracked and one broke off.  The battery has NEVER charged properly.  It won't take a charge at all now.  Their customer service is the worst I have ever experienced.  They offer NO technical help and finally ignore your emails.AFTER TRYING SEVERAL BRANDS I HAVE CONCLUDED THE BRAAVO JET is the best buy for your money, it cleans the floors the best and iRobot has FANTASTIC customer service.I truly wanted to love this machine and the few times it did work I loved it, but don't waste your money.NOTE:  I experimented with 2 different ILIFE V5s and they BOTH had the same problems, so I believe their machine is NOT READY to be on the market.",5

It is a dramatic improvement over doing the work manually.  DRAMATIC.  But the one downside is it takes a random path and needs redirection to cover your whole space.Overall PROS--price.  Many competitors (eg roomba and neato) are way too expensive--function.  It does a great job sweeping AND mopping.  It picks up medium size items (eg Toddler puffs) just fine.  The vacuuming function is a 3/5. It's okay.  It's pretty good. But I primarily think this little thing excels in sweeping and mopping. Other reviewers don't seem too keen on the mopping function--I think it works great.  I optimize it by spraying my tile with my everyday cleaning solution (few drops dawn into white vinegar).  Then I pour about a third of a standard size mug of hot water on top, swish it around the kitchen floor with my foot and let this little robot go to town.  NOTE DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK since yes it is an electronic device and you don't want it getting overly wet.  I haven't had a problem with using minimal hot water.--accessories and look: it's cute.  And it comes with two mopping pads and a little brush to clean the filter outCONS--it's random people.  I would pay $50 to $75 more for a device that tracks its path.  It needs some redirection to stay on path.  That being said it'll still do a good job if you let it run wild but it'll prob get stuck.Overall a great product.  I am so grateful for the time gained by not having to constantly sweep and mop (just FYI I have a young one so the floor is always getting some kind of puff or other food bit on it).",2

Yea, it will sense walls and crap, but if happily tries to vacuum up cords and many times has yanked my electronics from off their shelves by trying to run over their cords. They did not design this well or think this through.

Can't see any difference after using it for hours.","Nibblets3","October 12, 2016","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",1,"Didn't work. After several hours of testing on carpet and laminate flooring, it failed to make my floor look any cleaner and required constant monitoring as it got stuck on something about every 30 seconds or so (not an exaggeration!).The major problems:  - The microfiber pad does not move and the machine does not make mopping movements, it just drags the pad around. Because the machine is  very light, the pressure on the pad is not adequate to clean even very light blemishes on the floor.  - The wet mopping mode requires that you remove the vacuum dust bin and replace it with the water canister. So you cannot expect the floor to  be vacuumed and then mopped while you are away.  - You cannot leave the water canister in the machine when you are away. The water canister is designed to continuously drip water into the  microfiber pad. If you were to leave it in, you would end up with a water puddle when the machine docks (which would ruin the docking  system...as stated in the manual) or a puddle when it gets stuck (more likely).  - In mopping mode the machine cannot detect carpet and constantly gets stuck. During my test of the machine, it got stuck about every 30  seconds.  - In all modes the machine cannot overcome many obstacles such as ledges, furniture, debris, etc and is constantly getting stuck. It had a  particularly bad time with the base of our bar stools. They have circular convex stands that the machine would drive up and spin its wheels on  indefinitely. Our Roomba has no issue with these stools.  - The dust bin is very small, probably half the size of our Roomba's. So, you cannot expect it to clean much space, particularly if you have pets.  - The random pattern of cleaning caused it to only cover a few spots. It just kept passing over the same areas. Our roomba seems to clean pretty  randomly, but it still hits more areas than this machine.  - The vacuum inlet is very small, smaller than our dustbuster inlet.  - The images on the description showing the machine approaching water on the floor are entirely inaccurate. The machine cannot handle water.  The manual clearly states this.The positive attributes:  - Its quieter than the Roomba  - It seems to vacuum OK...not great, but some stuff gets picked up.  -",8

At the same time I hate living with dirty floors. This presents a challenge, as a have a large dog and 2 cats. I decided to take a chance and see if this would solve my problem. I must say I am very happy with this purchase. I get up in the morning and click the remote and just let him go about cleaning my floors while I am going about my business. He is quite entertaining to watch scooting around cleaning my floors. It is so easy to use I can run it every day with no problem. I was concerned that it might not do a good enough job and I would still have to clean the floors myself. I was pleasantly surprised. It does a really good job. Better than I would do myself actually. It gets under the furniture that it can fit under. The floors never feel gritty any more and gets up all the pet hair no problem. The only issue that I have had is that he sometimes gets stuck under my rocker-recliner and I have to free him, and also sometimes on the thresholds. We had some inch high thresholds when we first got him that he always got stuck on every time. We swapped them out for some lower ones and he mostly does fine. The only time he gets stuck on them now is if he decides to go in a circle on top of them.After I let him run for awhile I just click home. He gets confused and takes his time getting there sometimes, but he makes it without my help if I am patient. Then I just have to dump out the canister and put it back for next time. It is very easy to do this. You just click where it says push on the top and it comes open. It is easy to take out and put back in.The mop function also works well. It comes with a separate mop tank that you put water in. I also put in a dab of pine sol in there and it did a really good job. I have a small house, only 2 rooms to clean, so the tank was big enough to get everything. But if you have a larger area to clean you might have to refill it, as it is pretty small.This does not do carpets, but I was not expecting it to. It does fine on the small floor mats that we have though. Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has hard floors and does not like to clean them.",32

"992","ILIFE V5s Pro Robot Vacuum Mop Cleaner with Water Tank, Automatically Sweeping Scrubbing Mopping Floor Cleaning Robot","The Good, the Bad, and the..Wait, there is No Ugly - this Thing is Darned Cute!","Anne P. Mitchell","November 18, 2016","Size: V5sVerified Purchase",4,"I have previously had Roombas, and this time I was looking for something specifically good for pet hair.  I actually posted a request for input and advice on robot vacuums on my Facebook wall (I have over 4000 friends and followers, so it's a great way to get lots of input!), and a few people mentioned the iLife robot vacuums, and loving them.  So I checked out this iLife along with the Roomba offerings.I ultimately decided on the iLife based on the following things:- The reviews.  It is really clear from the reviews for the iLife that people *love* them (and with good cause)!  I saw way more raving here than for similar Roombas.- Price.  This iLife is much gentler on the wallet/pocketbook/purse/manpurse than similar Roombas.- Floor scratching.  I was really worried about my wood floors and vinyl floors getting scratched.  I had seen mentions of that in some Roomba reviews.  I hadn't seen any mention of scratching in any of the iLife reviews - which I knew didn't mean that it wouldn't/couldn't/hadn't happened, but the Roomba reviews meant that it *had* already happened with the Roomba.- This thing ""mops"" (for some value of ""mop"").  I wasn't looking for a robot to mop, but I figured if I was *already* leaning towards the iLife, it was a nifty extra feature.- What people said in response to my request on Facebook.  Here is an actual quote from that thread:  ""I have an iLife, at half the cost of the Roomba, and much easier on wood and vinyl floors. I’m happy with it.""So, I ordered this iLife V5s and was very excited for it to arrive (I'm such a geeky girl).And of course, I got it going as soon as the batteries were charged.  I've now run it several times, and here are my observations:The Good:~~~~~~~~This robot vacuum is *very* easy to use.  The remote is straight-forward.  It does what you tell it to do. (I have not tried scheduling it, as ...dog and cat.)It does a decent job of getting stuff off the floor, including both dog and cat hair!It truly will go wherever you will let it.  It went into 4 different rooms, and it went *under my bed* (much to my delight, and the cat's chagrin).It's *easy* to empty the dirt collector (wanted to say ""dirt box"", but that's something else entirely), and the dirt container is a decent size (at least in my experience compared to the Roomba).So far no discernible scratches on the floor.  The brushes are pretty stiff - I think that I still wish that they were a little less stiff, but they aren't as stiff as, say,  a wire brush (which would definitely scratch the floor).  I actually removed the brushes and tried running it that way, but it looked so pathetic running around without its 'arms' (and it didn't clean nearly as well), so I put them back on.  Still, so far so good.Oh, and check it out!  The ""mop"", which is a microfiber cloth, attaches to the underside of the vacuum via some velcro strips that are on the bottom of the vacuum...and you can also use them to attach a Swiffer Dry Sweeping cloth (Swiffer Sweeper Dry Sweeping Cloth Refills, and it will drag the cloth behind itself, grabbing even more dirt and stuff!  (I've tried attaching the Swiffer wet cloth, but the folds in the wet cloth once unfolded make it so that only a couple of points of the cloth actually have contact with the floor).The Bad:~~~~~~~Two different points of demerit (hence the 4-star instead of 5-star rating):1.  Remember how I said above that it will truly go into every room?  Every..single..time that it went into the bathroom, it would end up closing the bathroom door and trapping itself in there.  I ended up having to close the bathroom door to keep it out, meaning that my bathroom floor does not get cleaned.2.  It gets *hopelessly hung up* on floor registers that are not completely flat.  I have a wooden floor register in my bedroom, and it *always* gets stuck on it and can't move itself off of that floor register.  It doesn't seem to have that problem with the metal registers, which are slightly flatter, so I guess I'm going to have to replace the wooden one with another metal one.The Ugly:~~~~~~~As I said, there is no ugly, not in terms of how this thing performs, nor in terms of how it looks. It's so darned cute!  (What is it about us humans anthropomorphizing these things?)  At least I haven't put a bow, or a little outfit, on it.  Yet.I have not used the 'mopping' function, which is basically a small microfiber cloth you attach to the bottom after swapping out the dirt collection box for a water tank.  But in part that's because I LOVE my Bissell Symphony Pet All-in-One Vacuum and Steam Mop.  In fact, the iLife is basically for day-to-day vacuuming between the times I use my Symphony (steam mopping and vacuuming in one...gotta love it!)Bottom line:  I would absolutely recommend this unit to my friends - but I'd warn them about the floor register thing, and that this thing can't fight it's way out of a bathroom.",7

It does a great job sweeping up the floor.  My two complaints are that it doesn't run in any kind of consistent pattern and is all over the place, but it does get the job done, and on the mopping feature, the water basically pours out of the holding tank immediately upon putting it into the vacuum.  Once it gets going, it does okay, but do not let it sit for any amount of time or you will have a puddle of water on the floor.  Other than that, it's great.  Love it actually.",NA

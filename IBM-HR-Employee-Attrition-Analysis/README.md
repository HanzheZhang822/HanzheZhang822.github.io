# Employee Attrition Prediction Using Machine Learning (Python)

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **employee attrition** using machine learning techniques to uncover key factors influencing employee turnover. Using IBM's HR dataset, I applied **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and supervised learning models** to predict attrition with high accuracy.  

## 📊 Dataset Details  
- **Source:** [IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)  
- **Size:** 1,470 employee records with 35 features  
- **Key Features:** Age, Monthly Income, Job Role, Job Satisfaction, Distance from Home, etc.  
- **Target Variable:** Attrition (Yes/No)  

## 🛠️ Methods & Models Used  
✔ **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling  
✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Correlation analysis, distribution insights  
✔ **Machine Learning Models:**  
- **Logistic Regression** *(Best Model - 88.9% Accuracy)*  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Random Forest**  

✔ **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC  

## 🔥 Key Results & Insights  
📌 **Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy (88.9%)** among all models.  
📌 **Top 5 factors affecting attrition:** Age, Salary, Job Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance, Commute Distance.  
📌 **Employees who frequently travel and work overtime are more likely to leave.**  
📌 **Higher job satisfaction and career progression reduce attrition risks.**  

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated  
✅ **Python** – Data analysis & ML implementation  
✅ **Pandas & NumPy** – Data wrangling & preprocessing  
✅ **Scikit-Learn** – Model training & evaluation  
✅ **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization & insights  
✅ **Feature Engineering** – Data transformation & scaling  
✅ **Machine Learning** – Supervised learning, model tuning
